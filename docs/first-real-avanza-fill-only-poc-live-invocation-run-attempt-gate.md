## Action 1066 Follow-Up - Live Invocation Execution Gate

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_live_invocation_execution_gate_added`.
- Added `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-live-invocation-execution-gate.md` as the final documentation/decision gate before adding any live invocation execute wrapper/action.
- Gate decision: `live_invocation_execution_gate_ready`. This means ready to add a live invocation execution action/wrapper; it does not mean execution has occurred.
- Gate basis: immediate pre-invocation confirmation ready, final operator GO captured, live invocation run attempt gate ready, live invocation attempt dry-run simulation passed, final live attempt preflight checklist ready, all hard stops active, and no live invocation performed.
- Allowed future execution scope remains explicit-trigger only, user present, browser already manually opened, Avanza already manually logged in, read only required visible order-form state, fill only approved amount/price fields, capture evidence, and stop before `Granska köp`.
- Mandatory aborts remain operator absent, browser/session not prepared, account/instrument mismatch, wrong side/order type, amount/price mismatch, total parse failure, cap exceeded, validation errors, modal open, final confirm visible, review click targeted/requested, submit/order placement requested, credential/session handling requested, or any uncertainty.
- This remains documentation/decision-gate only: no live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.
- Recommended next action: Action 1067 - Add Live Invocation Execute Wrapper.

## Action 1065 Follow-Up - Immediate Pre-Invocation Confirmation Ready

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_ready`.
- Updated `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-immediate-pre-invocation-confirmation.md` to capture the exact operator-provided `IMMEDIATE PRE-INVOKE CONFIRMATION:` wording.
- Decision transition: `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_deferred` -> `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_ready`.
- Confirmation scope: operator present right now; Avanza open and logged in manually; BankID/2FA handled manually; Valentin Labs KF and GameStop still manually verified; buy-side Avancerad/Limit; amount 427,26 SEK; price 21,98 USD; total 438,05 SEK or otherwise under the 1,000 SEK cap; no modal open; no `Bekräfta köp/sälj` visible; `Granska köp` has not been clicked; browser can be closed immediately if anything is wrong; invocation must stop before `Granska köp`; abort on mismatch or uncertainty.
- Remaining hard stops: no `Granska köp`, no review modal, no `Bekräfta köp/sälj`, no submit/order placement, no unattended run, no credential/session handling, no sell/Stop Loss/Glidande, no cap above 1,000 SEK, and abort on mismatch/uncertainty.
- This remains documentation/decision-capture only: no live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.
- Recommended next action: Action 1066 - Add Live Invocation Execution Gate.

## Action 1064 Follow-Up - Immediate Pre-Invocation Confirmation

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_added`.
- Added `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-immediate-pre-invocation-confirmation.md` to capture whether the operator provided the immediate pre-invocation confirmation.
- Current decision: `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_deferred`. The current instruction did not include the exact required immediate confirmation text.
- Required exact wording is documented for the next operator input.
- Carry-forward state remains: final preflight ready, final operator GO captured, live attempt gate ready, dry-run simulation passed, hard stops active, and no live invocation performed.
- No live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.
- Recommended next action: Action 1065 - Provide Immediate Pre-Invocation Confirmation.

## Action 1063 Follow-Up - Final Live Attempt Preflight Checklist

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_attempt_preflight_checklist_added`.
- Added `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-final-live-attempt-preflight-checklist.md` as the final operator/system checklist immediately before any future live fill-only invocation attempt.
- Checklist decision: `final_live_attempt_preflight_ready`. This means the checklist is ready; it does not mean a live run occurred and does not authorize review, final confirm, submit, or order placement.
- Preflight basis records FINAL GO, run attempt gate readiness, dry-run simulation pass, fresh evidence readiness, operator checklist readiness, and active hard stops.
- The checklist covers final operator confirmation, final Browser/Avanza state, final wrapper/run boundary, and immediate abort conditions.
- No live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.
- Recommended next action: Action 1064 - Capture Immediate Pre-Invocation Confirmation.

## Action 1062 Follow-Up - Live Invocation Attempt Dry-Run Simulation

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_live_fill_only_invocation_attempt_dry_run_simulation_added`.
- Added `tests/e2e/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-live-fill-only-invocation-attempt-dry-run-simulation.spec.ts` as a local-only dry-run simulation for the Action 1061 attempt wrapper.
- Added `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-live-fill-only-invocation-attempt-dry-run-simulation.md` with the Action 1062 proof.
- Positive simulation reaches `attempt_plan_created` / `ready_for_live_fill_only_attempt` with all gates, final GO, final harness, final pre-run evidence, operator confirmations, cap, buy side, Avancerad/Limit, and evidence plan satisfied.
- Negative simulation coverage blocks or fails safety for disabled wrapper, missing gates/GO/wrapper/harness/evidence/operator/login/account/instrument, cap above 1,000 SEK, wrong side/order type, review/final/submit/order placement, credential/session handling, sell, Stop Loss, and Glidande.
- Runner boundary remains metadata-only; no fake runner or real runner is invoked.
- No live Avanza run, real browser launch/control, DOM query, credential/session handling, review click, review modal, final confirm, submit, order placement, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, real trade, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.
- Recommended next action: Action 1063 - Final Live Attempt Preflight Checklist.

## Action 1061 Follow-Up - Live Fill-Only Invocation Attempt Wrapper

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_live_fill_only_invocation_attempt_wrapper_added`.
- Added `lib/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-live-fill-only-invocation-attempt-wrapper.ts` as a disabled-by-default, explicit-trigger-only live attempt decision wrapper.
- Added `tests/e2e/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-live-fill-only-invocation-attempt-wrapper.spec.ts` to cover disabled, blocked, failed-safety, and attempt-plan-created states.
- Added `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-live-fill-only-invocation-attempt-wrapper.md` with the Action 1061 proof.
- `ready_for_live_fill_only_attempt` means the wrapper is ready under locked scope; it does not mean Avanza ran.
- `attempt_plan_created` means metadata plan only; it does not mean review, final confirm, submit, or order placement occurred.
- No live Avanza run, browser launch/control, credential/session handling, review click, review modal, final confirm, submit, order placement, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.
- Recommended next action: Action 1062 - Add Live Invocation Attempt Dry-Run Simulation.

# First Real Avanza Fill-Only POC Live Invocation Run Attempt Gate

## Purpose

This document records Action 1060: adding the live invocation run attempt gate for the first real Avanza fill-only POC.

This is not a live run. This document does not access Avanza, launch or control a browser, query DOM, fill fields, click `Granska köp`, open a review modal, click `Bekräfta köp/sälj`, submit, or place an order.

## Gate Basis

- Final operator GO is captured.
- Final pre-live review is ready.
- Final live invocation operator checklist is ready.
- Final live invocation wrapper simulation passed.
- Fresh pre-run evidence is ready.
- All hard stops remain active.

## Immediate Prerequisite Checklist

| Check | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Final operator GO | pass | Action 1059 captured exact `FINAL GO:` text. |
| Final pre-live review ready | pass | `final_pre_live_run_review_ready`. |
| Final pre-run evidence ready | pass | `final_pre_run_evidence_ready`. |
| Invocation wrapper simulation passed | pass | Final live invocation local simulation passed. |
| Operator present | pass | Confirmed by final GO text. |
| Manual login confirmed | pass | Confirmed by final GO text. |
| Account/instrument verified | pass | Confirmed by final GO text for Valentin Labs KF and GameStop. |
| Total below cap | pass | 438,05 SEK is below the 1,000 SEK cap. |
| No modal/final confirm evidence | pass | Fresh evidence recorded no confirmation modal and no `Bekräfta köp/sälj`. |
| Actual live invocation not performed yet | warn/expected | The live attempt has not happened and remains separately gated. |
| Live run evidence package not captured yet | warn/expected | The evidence package can only be captured by a future explicitly approved attempt. |

## Run Attempt Gate Decision

Run attempt gate decision: `live_invocation_run_attempt_gate_ready`.

This means ready to add a live invocation attempt action/wrapper. It does not mean the live invocation has occurred.

## Allowed Future Live Invocation Attempt

- Explicitly triggered only.
- User present.
- Browser already manually opened.
- Avanza already manually logged in.
- Read only required visible order-form state.
- Fill only approved amount/price fields.
- Capture evidence.
- Stop before `Granska köp`.
- No review click.
- No review modal.
- No final confirm.
- No submit/order placement.
- No credentials/session handling.
- No unattended operation.
- Abort on mismatch or uncertainty.

## Mandatory Live-Attempt Abort Conditions

- Operator absent.
- Browser/session not prepared.
- Account/instrument mismatch.
- Wrong side/order type.
- Amount/price mismatch.
- Total parse failure.
- Cap exceeded.
- Validation errors.
- Modal open.
- Final confirm visible.
- Review click targeted or requested.
- Submit/order placement requested.
- Credential/session handling requested.
- Any uncertainty.

## What Action 1061 May Add

- A final live invocation attempt wrapper/harness.
- Explicit-trigger-only behavior.
- Fill-only path only.
- Stop before `Granska köp`.
- Evidence capture.
- No review/final/submit clicks.
- No credential/session handling.
- No trade/PnL mutation unless separately approved.

## What Action 1061 Must Not Add

- No `Granska köp` click.
- No review modal.
- No final confirm.
- No submit/order placement.
- No unattended mode.
- No credentials/session.
- No sell/Stop Loss/Glidande.
- No cap above 1,000 SEK.
- No automatic mode.
- No post-run trade mutation without separate approval.

## Result Status

Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_live_invocation_run_attempt_gate_added`.

## Recommended Next Action

Recommended next action: Action 1061 - Add Live Fill-Only Invocation Attempt Wrapper.

Reason: after the run-attempt gate is ready, the next step may add the explicitly triggered live invocation attempt wrapper, still stopping before `Granska köp`.

## Progress Update

- Ture production/data-health: 95-97%.
- Market-window live dry-run: 92-95%.
- Semi-auto agent foundation: 98-99%.
- Semi-auto Avanza/browser-agent readiness: 99-100%.
- Real browser automation readiness: 99-100%.
- First Avanza fill-only POC readiness: 100%.
- Full-auto readiness: 10-15%.
- Total Ture toward semi-auto MVP: 99-100%.

## Not Performed

- No live Avanza run.
- No browser launch/control.
- No Avanza access.
- No DOM query.
- No field fill.
- No click.
- No `Granska köp`.
- No review modal.
- No `Bekräfta köp/sälj`.
- No submit.
- No order placement.
- No credential/session handling.
- No Supabase/DB call or write.
- No provider/route/scan invocation.
- No audit writer client invocation.
- No migration/typegen/generated type edit.
- No `.env.local` change.
- No real trade.
