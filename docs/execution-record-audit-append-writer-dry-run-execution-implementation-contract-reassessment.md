# Execution Record Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Implementation Contract Reassessment

## 1. Purpose

Action 722 reassesses the audit append writer dry-run execution implementation contract types created by Action 721.

This reassessment verifies that `lib/execution-record-audit-append-writer-dry-run-execution-implementation-contract.ts` remains type-only/constants-only, contract-only, dry-run-execution-implementation-contract-only, future-boundary-only, and disconnected from runtime dry-run execution, writer logic, route calls, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage writes, audit append execution, downstream actions, broker/Avanza behavior, and automatic mode.

No runtime code changes were made for this reassessment.

## 2. Current Contract Inventory

The Action 721 contract currently defines:

- implementation contract version
- implementation input
- implementation result
- statuses
- decision recommendations
- safety policy
- authority flags
- blocked reasons
- warnings
- review items
- simulated audit event payload
- simulated table/schema target
- simulated idempotency result
- simulated duplicate-prevention result
- evidence/provenance result
- server-only/security dependency result
- no-write/no-action safety summary
- dependency summary

The input contract can reference dry-run execution validator results, dry-run execution contract input/result, dry-run validator results, dry-run result input, writer contract validator results, writer validator results, audit writer contract input, audit event candidate, execution-record reference, evidence/provenance, idempotency keys, duplicate-prevention keys, proof statuses, explicit dry-run-only flag, service-role/client-write risk statuses, manual review metadata, and downstream authority metadata.

The result contract can describe a future deterministic non-persistent "would-write" diagnostic shape, but it does not execute a dry run and does not authorize a write.

## 3. Boundary Verification

Verified boundary:

- type-only/constants-only
- contract-only
- dry-run-execution-implementation-contract-only
- future-boundary-only
- no dry-run execution implementation
- no dry-run execution validator changes
- no writer implementation
- no audit append implementation
- no route calls
- no production route call
- no insert route call
- no execution-record creation
- no persistence/write
- no Supabase/localStorage write
- no audit write
- no stats/PnL update
- no rollback/correction
- no trade mutation/reconciliation
- no UI update
- no notification execution
- no browser/Avanza behavior
- no broker/order behavior
- no automatic mode

The reassessed contract imports types only, exports constants and types, and contains no function implementation, route handler, Supabase client, localStorage call, fetch call, audit writer invocation, record creation, UI state mutation, broker invocation, or Avanza/browser automation.

## 4. Proof/Write/Downstream Separation Verification

Verified separation:

- contract result success is not audit write approval
- contract result success is not audit append execution
- contract result success is not route call approval
- contract result success is not record creation approval
- contract result success is not persistence/write approval
- contract result success is not Supabase/localStorage write approval
- contract result success is not security proof
- contract result success is not server-only proof
- contract result success is not schema/table proof
- contract result success is not generated-types proof
- contract result success is not migration proof
- contract result success is not RLS/security proof
- contract result success is not downstream approval
- contract result success is not full workflow completion
- dry-run execution validator readiness is not execution
- dry-run execution validator readiness is not write approval
- contract validator readiness is not write approval
- writer validator readiness is not write approval
- insert success is not audit write approval
- dev-preview diagnostics are not write approval

The contract repeats these separations in the safety policy and result types through explicit `false` fields. This is useful friction: future callers must consciously cross a separate implementation, validator, route, schema, security, and authority boundary before any real write can exist.

## 5. Authority Flag Verification

Verified Action 721 authority defaults remain:

- `validationOnly: true`
- `designOnly: true`
- `dryRunExecutionOnly: true`
- `dryRunExecutionImplementationImplemented: false`
- `dryRunExecutionAllowed: false`
- `dryRunExecutedAgainstRealData: false`
- `dryRunImplemented: false`
- `writerImplemented: false`
- `auditAppendImplemented: false`
- `auditRouteImplemented: false`
- `auditWriteAllowed: false`
- `safeToWriteAudit: false`
- `auditAppendAllowed: false`
- `safeToAppendAudit: false`
- `routeCallAllowed: false`
- `recordCreationAllowed: false`
- `persistenceWriteAllowed: false`
- `supabaseWriteAllowed: false`
- `localStorageWriteAllowed: false`
- `statsPnlUpdateAllowed: false`
- `tradeMutationAllowed: false`
- `tradeReconciliationAllowed: false`
- `correctionRollbackAllowed: false`
- `uiStateMutationAllowed: false`
- `userNotificationAllowed: false`
- `brokerOrderFollowUpAllowed: false`
- `avanzaBrowserFollowUpAllowed: false`
- `safeToUpdateStats: false`
- `safeToMutateTrade: false`
- `safeToReconcileTrade: false`
- `safeToRollback: false`
- `safeToUpdateUiState: false`
- `safeToNotifyUser: false`
- `safeToRunBrokerAction: false`
- `safeToRunAvanzaBrowserAction: false`
- `automaticModeAllowed: false`

No authority flag grants write, route, mutation, notification, broker, Avanza, or automatic-mode capability.

## 6. Dependency/Blocker Verification

Remaining blockers:

- no audit schema/table proof
- no generated audit table types
- generated execution-record types alone are not enough
- no migration proof
- no RLS/security proof
- no server-only proof
- no service-role proof
- no route/auth boundary proof
- no writer implementation
- no dry-run execution implementation
- no production insert route
- no production insert/write path

These blockers remain intentionally unresolved. The contract can describe future diagnostics only; it cannot make absent schema, generated audit types, migrations, RLS policy, server-only boundaries, route auth, writer behavior, or production insert behavior true.

## 7. Alignment Verification

The contract aligns with the dry-run execution implementation design by keeping a future deterministic simulation shape separate from runtime behavior.

It aligns with the dry-run execution validator, dry-run execution validator dev-preview wiring reassessment, dry-run execution validator reassessment, dry-run execution validator contract reassessment, dry-run execution contract reassessment, dry-run execution design, dry-run validator reassessments, dry-run result contract reassessment, audit append writer implementation design, audit append writer contract validator reassessments, audit append writer validator reassessments, server-only/security checklist, audit append boundary docs, post-insert docs, production insert boundary docs, Supabase generated-types/migration docs, and two-stage broker evidence flow by preserving the same safety line:

- diagnostics are not writes
- validation readiness is not execution
- implementation contract types are not implementation
- dry-run success is not proof
- insert success is not audit write approval
- dev-preview diagnostics are not write approval
- all downstream authority remains absent

The Action 721 contract does not conflict with the related docs. It adds a shape for a future Action 723 implementation while leaving the execution, writer, route, schema, security, and production insert boundaries unopened.

## 8. Test Result Assessment

Action 721 validation results remain the latest runtime/type validation evidence for this contract:

- `./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit` passed
- `npm run lint` passed
- `git diff --check` passed
- `find docs -type f -size 0` passed with no output
- sandboxed `npm run test:e2e` hit the known `EPERM 0.0.0.0:3010` environment blocker before app logic
- escalated `npm run test:e2e` passed: 137/137

Action 722 is documentation-only. Its required verification is limited to whitespace and zero-byte-doc checks.

## 9. Candidate Next Actions

A. Create Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Implementation.

This is the most direct continuation. It would implement a pure deterministic non-persistent simulation using the Action 721 contract and must preserve all no-write/no-action boundaries.

B. Integrate Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Diagnostics into Dev Preview.

This would surface implementation diagnostics after a safe implementation exists. It should not precede the implementation unless it remains fixture-only.

C. Create Production Insert Route Implementation Design.

This would move the production write path planning forward, but it depends on stronger schema, security, generated-types, migration, and RLS proof artifacts.

D. Create Audit Writer Proof Artifact Checklist.

This would strengthen the proof trail before implementation. It is valuable if the team wants another documentation checkpoint before any future code.

## 10. Recommended Next Action

Recommended Action 723:

- Action 723 - Create Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Implementation

Rationale: the contract now exists and has been reassessed as safe, type-only, and no-write. The next useful step is a pure implementation that returns deterministic diagnostics only, still without audit writes, route calls, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage writes, downstream actions, broker/Avanza behavior, or automatic mode.

## 11. Risk Assessment

Risks to keep contained:

- contract types mistaken for implementation
- dry-run execution implementation mistaken for writer
- dry-run execution result mistaken for real write
- dry-run execution success mistaken for write approval
- dry-run execution success mistaken for proof
- dry-run execution success mistaken for downstream approval
- dry-run execution validator readiness mistaken for execution
- service role exposed
- client-side audit write introduced
- audit schema/table assumed without proof
- generated execution-record types assumed enough
- idempotency incomplete
- duplicate writes
- downstream authority accidentally enabled
- broker/Avanza accidentally triggered
- automatic mode accidentally enabled
- docs accidentally zeroed by bulk operations

Current mitigation is explicit: all authority flags remain false, all proof/write/downstream separations are encoded as false, and the reassessment preserves the no-runtime/no-write boundary.

## 12. Verification

Required Action 722 verification:

- `git diff --check`
- `find docs -type f -size 0`

Expected result:

- no whitespace errors
- no zero-byte docs
- no runtime code changes
- no dry-run execution implementation
- no audit writer
- no route calls
- no execution-record creation
- no persistence/write
- no Supabase/localStorage writes
- no audit append implementation

## Action 722 - Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Implementation Contract Types Reassessment

Action 722 added docs/execution-record-audit-append-writer-dry-run-execution-implementation-contract-reassessment.md as a documentation-only reassessment of the Action 721 contract types. It verifies the contract remains type-only/constants-only, contract-only, dry-run-execution-implementation-contract-only, future-boundary-only, and disconnected from runtime dry-run execution, writer logic, route calls, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage writes, audit append execution, downstream actions, broker/Avanza behavior, and automatic mode.

The reassessment confirms contract result success is not audit write approval, audit append execution, route approval, record creation approval, persistence/write approval, Supabase/localStorage write approval, security proof, server-only proof, schema/table proof, generated-types proof, migration proof, RLS/security proof, downstream approval, or full workflow completion. All action authority flags remain false.

Remaining blockers are unchanged: audit schema/table proof, generated audit table types, migration proof, RLS/security proof, server-only/service-role/route-auth proof, writer implementation, dry-run execution implementation, production insert route, and production insert/write path remain absent or unproven. Recommended next action: Action 723 - Create Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Implementation.

## Action 723 - Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Implementation

Action 723 added lib/execution-record-audit-append-writer-dry-run-execution-implementation.ts with executeAuditAppendWriterDryRun as a pure deterministic dry-run simulation only. The implementation inspects validated contract inputs and returns a non-persistent would-write diagnostic result with simulated audit event payload, table/schema target, idempotency, duplicate-prevention, evidence/provenance, server-only/security dependency, no-write/no-action, and dependency summaries.

No audit writer execution, audit append, audit route, production route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI update, notification execution, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, Supabase type generation, migration application, or audit schema/table assumption was added. Ready-for-design-only remains design_only_do_not_write_audit and is not audit write approval, route approval, persistence/write approval, security proof, server-only proof, schema/table proof, generated-types proof, migration proof, RLS/security proof, downstream approval, or full workflow completion.

Focused e2e coverage was added for ready simulation output, deterministic summaries, all-false authority flags, missing prerequisite blockers, unsafe authority invalidation, and no write/route/Supabase/localStorage side effects. Remaining blockers are unchanged for real audit writes: audit schema/table proof, generated audit table types, migration proof, RLS/security proof, server-only/service-role/route-auth proof, audit writer implementation, production insert route, and production insert/write path remain absent or unproven.


## Action 724 - Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Implementation Reassessment

Action 724 added docs/execution-record-audit-append-writer-dry-run-execution-implementation-reassessment.md as a documentation-only reassessment of executeAuditAppendWriterDryRun(...). The reassessment verifies the implementation remains pure, deterministic, non-persistent, diagnostics/readiness-only, and disconnected from audit writer execution, audit append execution, route calls, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage writes, downstream actions, broker/Avanza behavior, and automatic mode.

It confirms ready-for-design-only is design_only_do_not_write_audit and is not a real write, audit write approval, audit append execution, route approval, record creation approval, persistence/write approval, Supabase/localStorage write approval, security proof, server-only proof, schema/table proof, generated-types proof, migration proof, RLS/security proof, downstream action approval, or full workflow completion. All action authority flags remain false, and remaining blockers for real audit writes are unchanged.

Action 723 validation evidence remains: tsc passed, lint passed, git diff check passed, zero-byte docs check passed, sandbox e2e hit the known EPERM 0.0.0.0:3010 blocker before app logic, and escalated full e2e passed 139/139. Recommended next action: Action 725 - Integrate Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Diagnostics into Dev Preview.


## Action 725 - Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Diagnostics Dev Preview Integration

Action 725 integrated audit append writer dry-run execution diagnostics into the existing dev-gated persistence validator integration preview. The fixture now shapes fixture-only dry-run execution implementation input from existing validator, contract, dry-run, audit event, execution-record reference, evidence/provenance, idempotency, duplicate-prevention, proof-status, risk-status, manual-review, and downstream-authority artifacts, then calls executeAuditAppendWriterDryRun(...) for display-only diagnostics.

The preview now displays a visually separate Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution section with status, decision recommendation, deterministic simulated audit event payload, table/schema target, idempotency, duplicate-prevention, evidence/provenance, server-only/security dependency, no-write/no-action safety, dependency summary, authority flags, blocked reasons, warnings, and review items. The preview explicitly states the dry-run execution result remains non-persistent would-write diagnostics only and is not real write, audit write approval, audit append execution, route approval, record creation approval, persistence/write approval, Supabase/localStorage write approval, security proof, server-only proof, schema proof, generated-types proof, migration proof, RLS/security proof, downstream approval, or workflow completion.

All action authority flags remain false. No real dry-run against production data, audit writer execution, audit append execution, route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, source-of-truth UI update, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, Supabase type generation, migration application, or audit schema/table assumption was added. Recommended next action: Action 726 - Reassess Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Diagnostics Dev Preview Wiring.


### Action 725 Validation Results

Validation for Action 725: ./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit passed; npm run lint passed; git diff --check passed; find docs -type f -size 0 passed with no output. Sandboxed npm run test:e2e and sandboxed npm run test:e2e -- -g "dry-run execution" both failed before app test logic with the known EPERM 0.0.0.0:3010 web-server bind blocker. Escalated npm run test:e2e passed 139/139, and escalated npm run test:e2e -- -g "dry-run execution" passed 5/5.


## Action 726 - Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Diagnostics Dev Preview Wiring Reassessment

Action 726 added docs/execution-record-audit-append-writer-dry-run-execution-diagnostics-dev-preview-wiring-reassessment.md as a documentation-only reassessment of the Action 725 dev-preview wiring. The reassessment verifies that the persistence validator integration dev preview displays executeAuditAppendWriterDryRun(...) output from fixture-only data, remains dev-gated, explicit-trigger, read-only, visually separate, and non-persistent diagnostics-only.

It confirms the preview displays dry-run execution implementation status, design_only_do_not_write_audit decision, deterministic simulated audit event payload, table/schema target, idempotency, duplicate-prevention, evidence/provenance, server-only/security dependency, no-write/no-action safety, dependency summary, authority flags, blocked reasons, warnings, and review items. It also confirms visible safety labels state the dry-run execution result is not real write, audit write approval, audit append execution, route approval, record creation approval, persistence/write approval, Supabase/localStorage write approval, security proof, server-only proof, schema proof, generated-types proof, migration proof, RLS/security proof, downstream approval, or workflow completion.

No runtime behavior was changed for Action 726. No real dry-run execution against real data, audit writer execution, audit append, route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, type generation, migration application, or audit schema/table assumption was added. Recommended next action: Action 727 - Create Audit Writer Proof Artifact Checklist.


## Action 727 - Audit Writer Proof Artifact Checklist

Action 727 added docs/execution-record-audit-writer-proof-artifact-checklist.md as a documentation-only checklist for proof artifacts required before any real audit writer, audit route, audit append, production insert route link, or write path can be implemented. The checklist inventories required evidence for audit schema/table proof, migration proof, generated audit table types, remote environment verification, RLS/security, service-role/server-only boundaries, client-bundle scans, route/auth boundaries, idempotency and duplicate prevention, evidence/provenance, logging/error safety, downstream no-authority, no broker/Avanza/automatic behavior, rollback/unknown-status handling, manual review, dry-run chain limits, and production insert route separation.

The checklist is not proof by itself. It explicitly states that dry-run/dev-preview diagnostics are not proof, are not write approval, and cannot replace schema, security, route, idempotency, or remote environment evidence.

No runtime behavior was changed for Action 727. No audit writer, audit route, route call, production route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, audit append execution, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI update beyond existing diagnostics display, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, Supabase type generation, migration application, or audit schema/table assumption was added. Recommended next action: Action 728 - Reassess Audit Writer Proof Artifact Checklist.


## Action 728 - Audit Writer Proof Artifact Checklist Reassessment

Action 728 added docs/execution-record-audit-writer-proof-artifact-checklist-reassessment.md as a documentation-only reassessment of the Action 727 proof artifact checklist. The reassessment verifies that the checklist remains documentation-only, is not proof by itself, and only inventories proof requirements for audit schema/table design, migration, generated audit table types, remote environment, RLS/security, service-role/server-only boundaries, client-bundle scans, route/auth boundaries, idempotency and duplicate prevention, evidence/provenance, logging/error safety, downstream no-authority, no broker/Avanza/automatic behavior, rollback/unknown-status handling, manual review, dry-run chain limits, production insert route separation, blocker registry, and reviewer/date/blocker evidence fields.

The reassessment confirms the checklist does not create schema proof, migration proof, generated types proof, RLS proof, server-only proof, service-role proof, route/auth proof, idempotency proof, duplicate-prevention proof, evidence/provenance proof, downstream no-authority proof, or dry-run/dev-preview proof. Dry-run diagnostics and dev-preview visibility remain not proof and not write approval.

No runtime behavior was changed for Action 728. No audit writer, audit route, route call, production route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, audit append execution, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI update beyond existing diagnostics display, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, Supabase type generation, migration application, or audit schema/table assumption was added. Recommended next action: Action 729 - Create Audit Schema/Table Design.


## Action 729 - Audit Schema/Table Design

Action 729 added docs/execution-record-audit-schema-table-design.md as a documentation-only design for a future audit writer table. The design proposes public.execution_record_audit_events as a future append-only audit event table and documents proposed table identity, columns, constraints/indexes, idempotency and duplicate-prevention model, evidence/provenance model, RLS/security considerations, generated type requirements, migration requirements, relationships to the audit writer, production insert route, and dry-run diagnostics, open questions, remaining proof artifacts, risks, and next action.

The design is not schema proof, does not prove the table exists remotely, does not create or apply a migration, does not generate Supabase types, and does not approve any audit writer, route, route call, write path, audit append, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, downstream action, broker/Avanza behavior, or automatic mode. Dry-run/dev-preview diagnostics may reference the design only as a hypothetical target and remain not proof or write approval.

No runtime behavior was changed for Action 729. No migration file, migration application, generated types, audit writer, audit route, production route, route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, audit append execution, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI update beyond existing diagnostics display, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, or remote schema assumption was added. Recommended next action: Action 730 - Reassess Audit Schema/Table Design.


## Action 730 - Audit Schema/Table Design Reassessment

Action 730 added docs/execution-record-audit-schema-table-design-reassessment.md as a documentation-only reassessment of the Action 729 audit schema/table design. The reassessment verifies that docs/execution-record-audit-schema-table-design.md remains a non-proof design artifact for proposed public.execution_record_audit_events and covers table identity, the full column matrix, constraints/indexes, idempotency and duplicate-prevention, evidence/provenance, RLS/security considerations, generated type requirements, migration requirements, relationships to the audit writer, production insert route, and dry-run diagnostics, open questions, remaining proof gaps, and risks.

The reassessment confirms the design is not schema proof, not remote table proof, does not create or apply a migration, does not generate types, does not implement writer/route/write behavior, and does not close migration, generated-type, RLS/security, server-only/service-role, route/auth, idempotency, duplicate-prevention, or evidence/provenance proof gaps.

No runtime behavior was changed for Action 730. No migration file, migration application, generated types, audit writer, audit route, production route, route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, audit append execution, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI update beyond existing diagnostics display, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, or remote schema assumption was added. Recommended next action: Action 731 - Create Audit Table Migration Design.


## Action 731 - Audit Table Migration Design

Action 731 added docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-design.md as a documentation-only migration design for future public.execution_record_audit_events. The design translates the Action 729 schema/table design into proposed migration identity, intended operations, a clearly marked draft/non-applied SQL skeleton, idempotency and duplicate-prevention migration details, evidence/provenance fields, RLS/security considerations, generated type requirements, remote verification requirements, rollback/backout considerations, relationships to the audit writer, dry-run diagnostics, and production insert route, open questions, remaining proof artifacts, risks, and next action.

The migration design is not a migration file, is not migration proof, is not schema proof, does not prove the table exists remotely, does not apply anything, and does not generate Supabase types. Dry-run/dev-preview diagnostics may reference the proposed migration target only as hypothetical and remain not migration proof or write approval.

No runtime behavior was changed for Action 731. No migration file, migration application, generated types, audit writer, audit route, production route, route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, audit append execution, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI update beyond existing diagnostics display, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, or remote schema assumption was added. Recommended next action: Action 732 - Reassess Audit Table Migration Design.


## Action 732 - Audit Table Migration Design Reassessment

Action 732 added docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-design-reassessment.md as a documentation-only reassessment of the Action 731 audit table migration design. The reassessment verifies that docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-design.md remains a non-proof migration-design artifact for future public.execution_record_audit_events and covers proposed migration identity, path pattern, target schema/table, dependency on execution_records, intended SQL operations, draft SQL skeleton, idempotency and duplicate-prevention design, evidence/provenance design, RLS/security considerations, generated type requirements, remote verification requirements, rollback/backout considerations, relationships to the audit writer, dry-run diagnostics, and production insert route, open questions, proof gaps, and risks.

The reassessment confirms the migration design is not a migration file, not migration proof, not schema proof, not remote table proof, does not create or apply a migration, does not generate types, does not implement writer/route/write behavior, and does not close migration, generated-type, RLS/security, server-only/service-role, route/auth, idempotency, duplicate-prevention, or evidence/provenance proof gaps.

No runtime behavior was changed for Action 732. No migration file, migration application, generated types, audit writer, audit route, production route, route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, audit append execution, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI update beyond existing diagnostics display, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, or remote schema assumption was added. Recommended next action: Action 733 - Create Audit Table Migration File.


## Action 733 - Audit Table Migration File

Action 733 added supabase/migrations/20260615000000_create_execution_record_audit_events.sql as the local Supabase migration file for future public.execution_record_audit_events. The migration creates the audit event table with execution_record_id, event type/source/status fields, JSONB event/evidence/metadata payloads, actor/source/request/trace fields, idempotency and duplicate-prevention fields, timestamps, schema/writer version fields, non-empty checks for required text values, event_status allowlist, idempotency uniqueness, partial duplicate-prevention uniqueness, execution_record_id/event_type/event_status/created_at/source_fingerprint indexes, FK reference to public.execution_records(id), and safety comments.

The migration file is local only and was not applied. Remote table proof remains absent, generated audit table types were not generated, RLS/security/server-only/service-role proof remains missing, and no audit writer, audit route, production route, route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write behavior, audit append implementation, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, or remote schema assumption was added. The migration intentionally creates no permissive client write policy and leaves RLS/policy proof as a blocker before writer/route implementation.

Validation requested for Action 733 includes tsc, lint, git diff check, zero-byte docs check, and e2e. Recommended next action: Action 734 - Reassess Audit Table Migration File.


## Action 734 - Audit Table Migration File Reassessment

Action 734 added docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-file-reassessment.md as a documentation-only reassessment of the local audit table migration file supabase/migrations/20260615000000_create_execution_record_audit_events.sql. The reassessment verifies the migration file creates public.execution_record_audit_events locally with the expected columns, JSONB payloads, FK to public.execution_records(id), idempotency uniqueness, partial duplicate-prevention uniqueness, indexes, status/check constraints, safety comments, no permissive client write policies, and RLS/policy proof left as a blocker.

The reassessment confirms the migration file exists locally only, was not applied, does not prove the remote table exists, does not generate audit table types, does not prove RLS/security/server-only/service-role/route-auth safety, and does not create audit writer, audit route, production route, route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write behavior, audit append implementation, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, or downstream authority. Dry-run/dev-preview diagnostics remain not proof.

Action 733 validation evidence remains: tsc passed, lint passed, git diff check passed, zero-byte docs check passed, sandbox e2e hit the known EPERM 0.0.0.0:3010 blocker before app logic, and escalated full e2e passed 139/139. Recommended next action: Action 735 - Create Audit Table Migration Application Verification Plan.

## Action 735 - Audit Table Migration Application Verification Plan

- Added docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-application-verification-plan.md as the documentation-only plan for future verification of supabase/migrations/20260615000000_create_execution_record_audit_events.sql.
- The plan defines preconditions, future/manual application commands, remote table verification, RLS/security verification, generated audit type follow-up, rollback/failure handling, evidence artifacts with reviewer/date/pass-fail/blocker fields, safety boundaries, remaining blockers, risks, and verification.
- No migration was applied, no Supabase mutation commands were run, no generated audit types were produced, no remote table/RLS/security proof is claimed, and no writer, route, route call, insert path, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit append, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation, UI notification, broker behavior, Avanza behavior, or automatic mode was added.

## Action 736 - Audit Table Migration Application Verification Plan Reassessment

- Added docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-application-verification-plan-reassessment.md as the documentation-only reassessment of the Action 735 audit table migration application verification plan.
- The reassessment verifies the plan remains future/manual and non-proof, covers preconditions, command planning, remote table inspection, RLS/security checks, generated audit type follow-up, failure/rollback handling, evidence artifact fields, safety boundaries, remaining blockers, risks, and a concrete next action.
- No migration was applied, no Supabase mutation commands were run, no generated audit types were created, no remote table/RLS/security proof is claimed, and no writer, route, route call, insert path, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit append, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation, UI notification, broker behavior, Avanza behavior, or automatic mode was added.
- Recommended next action: Action 737 - Create Audit Table Generated Types Plan.

## Action 737 - Audit Table Generated Types Plan

- Added docs/execution-record-audit-table-generated-types-plan.md as the documentation-only plan for future Supabase TypeScript type generation and verification for public.execution_record_audit_events after the audit migration is applied and proven.
- The plan defines preconditions, future/manual generation commands, expected Row/Insert/Update/Relationships shape, verification checklist, type drift/blocker rules, relationships to audit writer, RLS/security, and migration proof, evidence artifacts, safety boundaries, risks, and next action.
- No migration was applied, no Supabase mutation commands were run, no type-generation commands were run, no generated type files were modified, no generated audit type proof is claimed, and no writer, route, route call, insert path, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit append, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation, UI notification, broker behavior, Avanza behavior, or automatic mode was added.
- Recommended next action: Action 738 - Reassess Audit Table Generated Types Plan.

## Action 738 - Audit Table Generated Types Plan Reassessment

- Added docs/execution-record-audit-table-generated-types-plan-reassessment.md as the documentation-only reassessment of the Action 737 generated types plan for public.execution_record_audit_events.
- The reassessment verifies the plan remains future/manual and non-proof, covers preconditions, type-generation command planning, expected Row/Insert/Update/Relationships shape, verification checklist, drift/blocker rules, writer/RLS/security/migration relationships, evidence artifacts, safety boundaries, remaining blockers, risks, and a concrete next action.
- No migration was applied, no Supabase mutation commands were run, no type-generation commands were run, no generated type files were modified, no generated audit type proof is claimed, and no writer, route, route call, insert path, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit append, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation, UI notification, broker behavior, Avanza behavior, or automatic mode was added.
- Recommended next action: Action 739 - Create RLS/Security Policy Design.

## Action 739 - RLS/Security Policy Design

- Added docs/execution-record-audit-rls-security-policy-design.md as the documentation-only RLS/security policy design for the future public.execution_record_audit_events table and audit writer path.
- The design defines desired security posture, RLS stance options, proposed policy model, server-only/service-role requirements, route/auth requirements, verification requirements, evidence artifacts, relationships to migration/generated types/audit writer/production insert route, remaining blockers, risks, and next action.
- No RLS policies were created or applied, no migration was applied, no Supabase mutation commands were run, no type-generation commands were run, no generated type files were modified, no RLS/security/server-only/service-role/route-auth proof is claimed, and no writer, route, route call, insert path, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit append, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation, UI notification, broker behavior, Avanza behavior, or automatic mode was added.
- Recommended next action: Action 740 - Reassess RLS/Security Policy Design.

## Action 740 - RLS/Security Policy Design Reassessment

- Added docs/execution-record-audit-rls-security-policy-design-reassessment.md as the documentation-only reassessment of the Action 739 RLS/security policy design for public.execution_record_audit_events.
- The reassessment verifies the design remains non-proof and covers desired security posture, RLS stance options, proposed policy model, server-only/service-role requirements, route/auth requirements, verification/evidence coverage, relationships, remaining blockers, risks, and a concrete next action.
- No RLS policies were created or applied, no migration was applied, no Supabase mutation commands were run, no type-generation commands were run, no generated type files were modified, no RLS/security/server-only/service-role/route-auth proof is claimed, and no writer, route, route call, insert path, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit append, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation, UI notification, broker behavior, Avanza behavior, or automatic mode was added.
- Recommended next action: Action 741 - Create Server-Only Service Role Proof Plan.
