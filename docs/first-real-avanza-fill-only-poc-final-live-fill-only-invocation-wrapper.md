## Action 1066 Follow-Up - Live Invocation Execution Gate

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_live_invocation_execution_gate_added`.
- Added `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-live-invocation-execution-gate.md` as the final documentation/decision gate before adding any live invocation execute wrapper/action.
- Gate decision: `live_invocation_execution_gate_ready`. This means ready to add a live invocation execution action/wrapper; it does not mean execution has occurred.
- Gate basis: immediate pre-invocation confirmation ready, final operator GO captured, live invocation run attempt gate ready, live invocation attempt dry-run simulation passed, final live attempt preflight checklist ready, all hard stops active, and no live invocation performed.
- Allowed future execution scope remains explicit-trigger only, user present, browser already manually opened, Avanza already manually logged in, read only required visible order-form state, fill only approved amount/price fields, capture evidence, and stop before `Granska köp`.
- Mandatory aborts remain operator absent, browser/session not prepared, account/instrument mismatch, wrong side/order type, amount/price mismatch, total parse failure, cap exceeded, validation errors, modal open, final confirm visible, review click targeted/requested, submit/order placement requested, credential/session handling requested, or any uncertainty.
- This remains documentation/decision-gate only: no live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.
- Recommended next action: Action 1067 - Add Live Invocation Execute Wrapper.

## Action 1065 Follow-Up - Immediate Pre-Invocation Confirmation Ready

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_ready`.
- Updated `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-immediate-pre-invocation-confirmation.md` to capture the exact operator-provided `IMMEDIATE PRE-INVOKE CONFIRMATION:` wording.
- Decision transition: `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_deferred` -> `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_ready`.
- Confirmation scope: operator present right now; Avanza open and logged in manually; BankID/2FA handled manually; Valentin Labs KF and GameStop still manually verified; buy-side Avancerad/Limit; amount 427,26 SEK; price 21,98 USD; total 438,05 SEK or otherwise under the 1,000 SEK cap; no modal open; no `Bekräfta köp/sälj` visible; `Granska köp` has not been clicked; browser can be closed immediately if anything is wrong; invocation must stop before `Granska köp`; abort on mismatch or uncertainty.
- Remaining hard stops: no `Granska köp`, no review modal, no `Bekräfta köp/sälj`, no submit/order placement, no unattended run, no credential/session handling, no sell/Stop Loss/Glidande, no cap above 1,000 SEK, and abort on mismatch/uncertainty.
- This remains documentation/decision-capture only: no live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.
- Recommended next action: Action 1066 - Add Live Invocation Execution Gate.

## Action 1064 Follow-Up - Immediate Pre-Invocation Confirmation

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_added`.
- Added `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-immediate-pre-invocation-confirmation.md` to capture whether the operator provided the immediate pre-invocation confirmation.
- Current decision: `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_deferred`. The current instruction did not include the exact required immediate confirmation text.
- Required exact wording is documented for the next operator input.
- Carry-forward state remains: final preflight ready, final operator GO captured, live attempt gate ready, dry-run simulation passed, hard stops active, and no live invocation performed.
- No live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.
- Recommended next action: Action 1065 - Provide Immediate Pre-Invocation Confirmation.

## Action 1063 Follow-Up - Final Live Attempt Preflight Checklist

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_attempt_preflight_checklist_added`.
- Added `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-final-live-attempt-preflight-checklist.md` as the final operator/system checklist immediately before any future live fill-only invocation attempt.
- Checklist decision: `final_live_attempt_preflight_ready`. This means the checklist is ready; it does not mean a live run occurred and does not authorize review, final confirm, submit, or order placement.
- Preflight basis records FINAL GO, run attempt gate readiness, dry-run simulation pass, fresh evidence readiness, operator checklist readiness, and active hard stops.
- The checklist covers final operator confirmation, final Browser/Avanza state, final wrapper/run boundary, and immediate abort conditions.
- No live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.
- Recommended next action: Action 1064 - Capture Immediate Pre-Invocation Confirmation.

## Action 1062 Follow-Up - Live Invocation Attempt Dry-Run Simulation

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_live_fill_only_invocation_attempt_dry_run_simulation_added`.
- Added `tests/e2e/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-live-fill-only-invocation-attempt-dry-run-simulation.spec.ts` as a local-only dry-run simulation for the Action 1061 attempt wrapper.
- Added `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-live-fill-only-invocation-attempt-dry-run-simulation.md` with the Action 1062 proof.
- Positive simulation reaches `attempt_plan_created` / `ready_for_live_fill_only_attempt` with all gates, final GO, final harness, final pre-run evidence, operator confirmations, cap, buy side, Avancerad/Limit, and evidence plan satisfied.
- Negative simulation coverage blocks or fails safety for disabled wrapper, missing gates/GO/wrapper/harness/evidence/operator/login/account/instrument, cap above 1,000 SEK, wrong side/order type, review/final/submit/order placement, credential/session handling, sell, Stop Loss, and Glidande.
- Runner boundary remains metadata-only; no fake runner or real runner is invoked.
- No live Avanza run, real browser launch/control, DOM query, credential/session handling, review click, review modal, final confirm, submit, order placement, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, real trade, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.

# First Real Avanza Fill-Only POC Final Live Fill-Only Invocation Wrapper

## Purpose

This document records Action 1055: adding the final live fill-only invocation wrapper for the first real Avanza fill-only POC.

This is not a completed live run. The wrapper remains gated and disabled by default. It still does not click `Granska kop`, open a review modal, click `Bekrafta kop`, click `Bekrafta salj`, submit, or place an order.

## Implementation

- Helper path: `lib/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-final-live-fill-only-invocation-wrapper.ts`.
- Test path: `tests/e2e/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-final-live-fill-only-invocation-wrapper.spec.ts`.
- Primary builder: `buildFirstFillOnlyPocFinalLiveFillOnlyInvocationDecision(...)`.
- Result statuses: `disabled`, `blocked`, `ready_for_live_fill_only_invocation`, and `failed_safety`.
- The wrapper composes the existing final real browser fill-only run harness and carries through the gated real browser run adapter, real browser adapter skeleton, execution dry-run adapter, manual run setup adapter, gated adapter skeleton, implementation stub, approval contract, dry-run harness, fill-only guard, and selector mapping contract.
- No runner interface is executed or exposed by default in this action.

## Scope
