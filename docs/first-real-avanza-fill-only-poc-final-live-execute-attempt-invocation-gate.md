# First Real Avanza Fill-Only POC Final Live Execute Attempt Invocation Gate

## 1. Purpose

This adds the final live execute attempt invocation gate.

This is not a live run. This does not access Avanza, launch/control a browser, query DOM, fill fields, click anything, open a review modal, submit/place an order, handle credentials/session data, mutate trades/stats/PnL, invoke or execute the exact trigger phrase, or call the trigger/action/wrapper/runner.

Ready never means execution occurred.

## 4. Final Invocation Gate Decision

Decision: `final_live_execute_attempt_invocation_gate_ready`

This means the final live execute attempt invocation gate is ready for adding a future final invocation checklist/action. It does not mean execution has occurred.

## 5. Allowed Future Scope

The only allowed future scope is:

- Documentation/static invocation checklist or readiness action only unless separately approved.
- Exact trigger phrase is captured but not invoked by Action 1101.
- Final readiness checklist confirmation is captured but does not execute anything.
- Trigger/action/wrapper/runner are not invoked by Action 1101.
- Any future invocation must still be explicit-trigger only.
- Any future invocation must still require operator presence.
- Any future invocation must still require Avanza already manually opened/logged in by user.
- Any future invocation must still require BankID/2FA already manually handled by user.
- Any future invocation must still require account and instrument manually verified by user.
- Any future invocation must still use existing Action 1084 trigger.
- Any future invocation must still use existing Action 1079 action.
- Any future invocation must still use existing Action 1073 wrapper only.
- Any future invocation must still use only the approved six-method runner boundary.
- Any future invocation must read only required visible order-form state.
- Any future invocation may fill only approved amount/price fields.
- Any future invocation may read total.
- Any future invocation may capture evidence.
- Any future invocation must stop before Granska köp.
- No Granska köp click.
- No review modal.
- No final confirm.
- No Bekräfta köp/sälj.
- No submit/order placement.
- No credentials/session handling.
- No cookies/localStorage/sessionStorage handling.
- No unattended operation.
- No automatic UI/routes/provider/scanner/package-script trigger.
- Abort on mismatch/uncertainty.

Approved values remain:

- Account: Valentin Labs KF
- Instrument: GameStop
- Order mode: Avancerad/Limit
- Side: Buy-only
- Amount: 427,26 SEK
- Price: 21,98 USD
- Total: 438,05 SEK or otherwise under 1,000 SEK cap
- Cap: <= 1,000 SEK

Approved runner boundary remains:

- `verifyVisibleOrderFormState`
- `fillAmountField`
- `fillPriceField`
- `readTotalAmount`
- `captureEvidence`
- `stopBeforeReview`

## 7. What Action 1102 May Add

Action 1102 may add a future final live execute attempt invocation checklist, if still approved.

Action 1102 may only add:

- `final_live_execute_attempt_readiness_checklist_confirmation_gate_ready` does not mean execution occurred.
- `final_live_execute_attempt_invocation_gate_ready` does not mean execution occurred.

Action 1102 must still not place an order and must still not click Granska köp.

## 8. What Action 1102 Must Not Add

Action 1102 must not add:

- No live run.
- No browser launch/control.
- No Avanza access.

## 10. Result Status

Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_invocation_gate_added`

## 11. Recommended Next Action

Recommended next action: Action 1102 — Add Final Live Execute Attempt Invocation Checklist

Reason: after the final live execute attempt invocation gate is ready, the next step may add a final invocation checklist before any exact trigger phrase invocation or explicit final live execute attempt trigger can be considered. This still must not place an order, must still not click Granska köp, and must not itself perform a live run.

Action 1102 must still not place an order and must still not click Granska köp. Do not recommend a live attempt yet. Do not run the trigger yet.

## 12. Progress Update

- Ture production/data-health: 95-97%
- Market-window live dry-run: 92-95%
- Semi-auto agent foundation: 98-99%
- Semi-auto Avanza/browser-agent readiness: 99-100%
- Real browser automation readiness: 100%
- First Avanza fill-only POC readiness: 100%
- Full-auto readiness: 10-15% deferred
- Total Ture toward semi-auto MVP: 99-100%

Full-auto remains explicitly deferred.

## 13. Validation Notes

- This was documentation/static invocation gate only.
- The final readiness checklist confirmation was captured in Action 1099.
- The exact trigger phrase was already captured in Action 1091.
- The exact trigger phrase was not invoked or executed.
- The trigger/action/wrapper/runner was not invoked.
- This gate is ready only for adding a future final invocation checklist/action.
- No live run occurred.
- No browser was launched or controlled.
- No Avanza access occurred.
- No DOM query occurred.
- No field fill occurred.
- No click occurred.
- No review modal was opened.
- No submit/order placement occurred.
- No credentials/session data were handled.
- No Supabase/provider/scan/audit-writer invocation occurred.
- Denial harness scripts were skipped because they would execute live Supabase checks and are outside this documentation/static invocation gate action.

Action 1108 confirms the final explicit trigger invocation checklist confirmation gate is ready. It is documentation/static gate propagation only.

This does not mean execution occurred. This does not mean a live Avanza attempt occurred. This does not mean an order was placed. The exact trigger phrase was captured previously but was not invoked or executed by Action 1108. The trigger/action/wrapper/runner were not invoked by Action 1108.

No live Avanza/browser/DOM/fill/click/review/final/submit/order-placement/Supabase/provider/scan/audit-writer invocation occurred. No runtime code, browser automation import, DOM query, route, provider, scanner, package script, migration, typegen, generated type, trade, stats, PnL, or .env.local changes were made by this action.

Approved runner boundary remains locked to `verifyVisibleOrderFormState`, `fillAmountField`, `fillPriceField`, `readTotalAmount`, `captureEvidence`, and `stopBeforeReview`. The stop-before-review boundary remains mandatory: no Granska kop click, no review modal, no final confirmation, and no order placement.

Progress/readiness remains:

- Ture production/data-health: 95-97%
- Market-window live dry-run: 92-95%
- Semi-auto agent foundation: 98-99%
- Semi-auto Avanza/browser-agent readiness: 99-100%
- Real browser automation readiness: 100%
- First Avanza fill-only POC readiness: 100%
- Full-auto readiness: 10-15% deferred
- Total Ture toward semi-auto MVP: 99-100%

Action 1109 confirms the final exact trigger phrase invocation request gate is ready. It is documentation/static request-gate propagation only.

This does not mean execution occurred. This does not mean a live Avanza attempt occurred. This does not mean an order was placed. The exact trigger phrase was captured previously but was not invoked or executed by Action 1109. The trigger/action/wrapper/runner were not invoked by Action 1109.

No live Avanza/browser/DOM/fill/click/review/final/submit/order-placement/Supabase/provider/scan/audit-writer invocation occurred. No runtime code, browser automation import, DOM query, route, provider, scanner, package script, migration, typegen, generated type, trade, stats, PnL, or .env.local changes were made by this action.

Approved runner boundary remains locked to `verifyVisibleOrderFormState`, `fillAmountField`, `fillPriceField`, `readTotalAmount`, `captureEvidence`, and `stopBeforeReview`. The stop-before-review boundary remains mandatory: no Granska kop click, no review modal, no final confirmation, and no order placement.

Progress/readiness remains:

- Ture production/data-health: 95-97%
- Market-window live dry-run: 92-95%
- Semi-auto agent foundation: 98-99%
- Semi-auto Avanza/browser-agent readiness: 99-100%
- Real browser automation readiness: 100%
- First Avanza fill-only POC readiness: 100%
- Full-auto readiness: 10-15% deferred
- Total Ture toward semi-auto MVP: 99-100%

Action 1110 confirms the final exact trigger phrase invocation request checklist is ready. It is documentation/checklist-only propagation.

This does not mean execution occurred. This does not mean a live Avanza attempt occurred. This does not mean an order was placed.
