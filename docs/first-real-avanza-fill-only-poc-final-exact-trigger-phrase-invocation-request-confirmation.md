# First Real Avanza Fill-Only POC Final Exact Trigger Phrase Invocation Request Confirmation

## 1. Purpose

This captures the final exact trigger phrase invocation request confirmation.

This is not a live run. This does not access Avanza, launch/control a browser, query DOM, fill fields, click anything, open a review modal, submit/place an order, handle credentials/session data, mutate trades/stats/PnL, invoke or execute the exact trigger phrase, or call the trigger/action/wrapper/runner.

Ready never means execution occurred.

## 2. Confirmation Basis

- Final exact trigger phrase invocation request checklist is ready: `final_exact_trigger_phrase_invocation_request_checklist_ready`
- Exact fresh final exact trigger phrase invocation request confirmation text has now been provided.
- Final exact trigger phrase invocation request gate is ready: `final_exact_trigger_phrase_invocation_request_gate_ready`
- Final explicit trigger invocation checklist confirmation gate is ready: `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_trigger_invocation_checklist_confirmation_gate_ready`
- Final explicit trigger invocation checklist confirmation is ready: `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_trigger_invocation_checklist_confirmation_ready`
- Exact trigger phrase capture is ready: `final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_capture_ready`
- Exact trigger phrase was captured by Action 1091 but not invoked.
- Exact trigger phrase itself must still be explicitly provided again in a future separate request before invocation can be considered.
- Explicit invocation trigger is not wired to UI/routes/provider/scanner/package scripts.
- Trigger/action/wrapper/runner are not invoked by this action.
- All hard stops remain active.
- No live invocation has been performed.
- No order has been placed.

## 3. Captured Confirmation Text

Recorded verbatim:

```text
FINAL EXACT TRIGGER PHRASE INVOCATION REQUEST CONFIRMATION: I confirm right now that I am present, Avanza is open and logged in manually, BankID/2FA has already been handled manually by me, account Valentin Labs KF and instrument GameStop are still manually verified, the order form is still buy-side Avancerad/Limit, amount is still 427,26 SEK, price is still 21,98 USD, total is still 438,05 SEK or otherwise under the 1,000 SEK cap, no modal is open, no Bekräfta köp/sälj is visible, Granska köp has not been clicked, the exact trigger phrase has been captured but has not been invoked or executed, the trigger/action/wrapper/runner have not been invoked, I understand that the exact trigger phrase itself must still be explicitly provided again in a future separate request before any invocation can be considered, and any future exact trigger phrase invocation must still use the approved explicit invocation trigger, action, and wrapper boundary to verify visible state, fill the approved amount and price fields, read total, capture evidence, and stop before Granska köp, it must not click Granska köp, must not open review modal, must not click Bekräfta köp/sälj, must not submit/place an order, must not handle credentials/session data, must not run unattended, must not be wired to automatic UI/routes/provider/scanner/package scripts, and must abort on any mismatch or uncertainty.
```

## 4. Captured Exact Trigger Phrase Reminder

Reminder only:

```text
FINAL LIVE EXECUTE ATTEMPT EXPLICIT INVOCATION TRIGGER: I explicitly request the final live fill-only execute attempt trigger now, with the approved boundary, stopping before Granska köp and without order placement.
```

The exact trigger phrase has been captured but is not invoked or executed by this action. The exact trigger phrase itself must still be explicitly provided again in a future separate request before invocation can be considered. The trigger phrase does not authorize review click, final confirm, submit, or order placement. The trigger phrase must not be treated as live execution.

## 5. Confirmation Status

| Confirmation item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Final exact trigger phrase invocation request checklist exists | PASS | `final_exact_trigger_phrase_invocation_request_checklist_ready` |
| Exact fresh operator request confirmation provided | PASS | Captured verbatim in Action 1111 |
| Exact trigger phrase captured | PASS | `final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_capture_ready` |
| Exact trigger phrase explicitly provided again for invocation | BLOCK | Must be separate future request, not Action 1111 |
| Exact trigger phrase invoked by this action | BLOCK | Must not be invoked in this confirmation-capture action |
| Trigger/action/wrapper/runner invoked by this action | BLOCK | Must not be invoked in this confirmation-capture action |
| Confirmation captured as ready | PASS | `final_exact_trigger_phrase_invocation_request_confirmation_ready` |
| Live explicit invocation performed by this action | BLOCK | This action is documentation/decision-capture only |

## 6. Confirmation Decision

Decision: `final_exact_trigger_phrase_invocation_request_confirmation_ready`

This means the final exact trigger phrase invocation request confirmation has been freshly provided and captured. It does not mean execution has occurred.

## 11. Result Status

Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_exact_trigger_phrase_invocation_request_confirmation_ready`

## 12. Recommended Next Action

Recommended next action: Action 1112 — Add Final Exact Trigger Phrase Invocation Request Confirmation Gate

Reason: after the final exact trigger phrase invocation request confirmation is captured, the next step should add a final exact trigger phrase invocation request confirmation gate before the exact trigger phrase itself can be provided again in a separate future request or any explicit final live execute attempt trigger can be considered.

Action 1112 must still not place an order and must still not click Granska köp. Do not recommend a live attempt yet. Do not run the trigger yet.

## 13. Progress Update

- Ture production/data-health: 95-97%

Action 1111 captures the exact fresh final exact trigger phrase invocation request confirmation as documentation/decision-capture only.

This does not mean execution occurred. This does not mean a live Avanza attempt occurred. This does not mean an order was placed. The exact trigger phrase remains captured but was not invoked or executed by Action 1111. The exact trigger phrase itself must still be explicitly provided again in a future separate request before invocation can be considered. The trigger/action/wrapper/runner were not invoked by Action 1111.

No live Avanza/browser/DOM/fill/click/review/final/submit/order-placement/Supabase/provider/scan/audit-writer invocation occurred. No runtime code, browser automation import, DOM query, route, provider, scanner, package script, migration, typegen, generated type, trade, stats, PnL, or .env.local changes were made by this action.

Approved runner boundary remains locked to `verifyVisibleOrderFormState`, `fillAmountField`, `fillPriceField`, `readTotalAmount`, `captureEvidence`, and `stopBeforeReview`. The stop-before-review boundary remains mandatory: no Granska kop click, no review modal, no final confirmation, and no order placement.

Progress/readiness remains:

- Ture production/data-health: 95-97%
- Market-window live dry-run: 92-95%

Action 1112 confirms the final exact trigger phrase invocation request confirmation gate is ready. It is documentation/static confirmation-gate propagation only.

This does not mean execution occurred. This does not mean a live Avanza attempt occurred. This does not mean an order was placed. The exact trigger phrase remains captured but was not invoked or executed by Action 1112. The exact trigger phrase itself must still be explicitly provided again in a future separate request before invocation can be considered. The trigger/action/wrapper/runner were not invoked by Action 1112.

No live Avanza/browser/DOM/fill/click/review/final/submit/order-placement/Supabase/provider/scan/audit-writer invocation occurred. No runtime code, browser automation import, DOM query, route, provider, scanner, package script, migration, typegen, generated type, trade, stats, PnL, or .env.local changes were made by this action.

Approved runner boundary remains locked to `verifyVisibleOrderFormState`, `fillAmountField`, `fillPriceField`, `readTotalAmount`, `captureEvidence`, and `stopBeforeReview`.

Action 1113 confirms the final exact trigger phrase re-provision gate is ready. It is documentation/static re-provision-gate propagation only.

This does not mean execution occurred. This does not mean a live Avanza attempt occurred. This does not mean an order was placed. The exact trigger phrase is historically captured but was not invoked or executed by Action 1113. The exact trigger phrase itself must still be explicitly provided again in a future separate request before invocation can be considered. The trigger/action/wrapper/runner were not invoked by Action 1113.

No live Avanza/browser/DOM/fill/click/review/final/submit/order-placement/Supabase/provider/scan/audit-writer invocation occurred. No runtime code, browser automation import, DOM query, route, provider, scanner, package script, migration, typegen, generated type, trade, stats, PnL, or .env.local changes were made by this action.

Approved runner boundary remains locked to `verifyVisibleOrderFormState`, `fillAmountField`, `fillPriceField`, `readTotalAmount`, `captureEvidence`, and `stopBeforeReview`. The stop-before-review boundary remains mandatory: no Granska kop click, no review modal, no final confirmation, and no order placement.
