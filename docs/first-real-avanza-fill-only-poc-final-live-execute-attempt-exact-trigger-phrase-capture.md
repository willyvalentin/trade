# First Real Avanza Fill-Only POC - Final Live Execute Attempt Exact Trigger Phrase Capture

## 1. Purpose

This captures the final live execute attempt exact trigger phrase.

This is not a live run. It does not access Avanza. It does not launch or control a browser. It does not query DOM. It does not fill fields. It does not click anything. It does not open a review modal. It does not submit or place an order. It does not handle credentials or session data. It does not mutate trades, stats, or PnL. It does not invoke or execute the exact trigger phrase.

Ready never means execution occurred. A ready capture state only means the exact phrase has been provided and recorded; it is not live execution and it is not order placement.

## 2. Capture Basis

The exact trigger phrase capture is based on the current documented chain:

| Basis item | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Previous exact trigger phrase capture decision was deferred | `final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_capture_deferred` |
| Exact trigger phrase has now been provided | PASS |
| Final explicit invocation trigger final gate is ready | `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_final_gate_ready` |
| Final live execute attempt explicit invocation trigger preflight confirmation is ready | `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_preflight_confirmation_ready` |
| Final live execute attempt explicit invocation trigger preflight checklist is ready | `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_preflight_checklist_ready` |
| Final live execute attempt explicit invocation trigger simulation passed | `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_simulation_added` |
| Final live execute attempt explicit invocation trigger exists | `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_added` |
| Final live execute attempt explicit invocation final gate is ready | `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_final_gate_ready` |
| Final live execute attempt explicit invocation preflight confirmation is ready | `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_preflight_confirmation_ready` |
| Final live execute attempt explicit invocation preflight checklist is ready | `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_preflight_checklist_ready` |
| Final live execute attempt explicit invocation simulation passed | `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_simulation_added` |
| Final live execute attempt explicit invocation action exists | `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_action_added` |
| Final live execute attempt execution gate is ready | `final_live_execute_attempt_execution_gate_ready` |
| Final live execute attempt checklist confirmation is ready | `final_live_execute_attempt_checklist_confirmation_ready` |
| Final live execute attempt checklist is ready | `final_live_execute_attempt_checklist_ready` |
| Final execute attempt gate is ready | `final_execute_attempt_gate_ready` |
| Execute checklist confirmation is ready | `execute_checklist_confirmation_ready` |
| Final live invocation execute checklist is ready | `final_live_invocation_execute_checklist_ready` |
| Live invocation execution gate is ready | `live_invocation_execution_gate_ready` |
| Immediate pre-invocation confirmation is ready | `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_ready` |
| Final operator GO captured | `final_operator_go` |
| Final pre-run evidence is ready | `final_pre_run_evidence_ready` |
| Live invocation run attempt gate is ready | `live_invocation_run_attempt_gate_ready` |

First POC approval and locked scope are captured. The exact trigger phrase requirement is documented and tested. The exact trigger phrase is captured by this action but is not invoked by this action. The explicit invocation trigger is not wired to UI, routes, provider, scanner, or package scripts. All hard stops remain active. No live invocation has been performed. No order has been placed.

Status meanings remain unchanged:

- `ready_for_final_live_execute_attempt` does not mean execution occurred.
- `final_live_execute_attempt_plan_created` does not mean order placement.
- `ready_for_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation` does not mean execution occurred.
- `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_plan_created` does not mean order placement.
- `ready_for_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger` does not mean execution occurred.
- `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_plan_created` does not mean order placement.
- `final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_capture_ready` does not mean execution occurred.

## 3. Captured Exact Trigger Phrase

Captured exact trigger phrase:

```text
FINAL LIVE EXECUTE ATTEMPT EXPLICIT INVOCATION TRIGGER: I explicitly request the final live fill-only execute attempt trigger now, with the approved boundary, stopping before Granska köp and without order placement.
```

The exact trigger phrase is captured by this action. The exact trigger phrase is not invoked or executed by this action.

The trigger phrase does not authorize review click, final confirm, submit, or order placement.

## 4. Exact Trigger Phrase Capture Status

| Capture item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Previous exact trigger phrase capture state was deferred | PASS | `final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_capture_deferred` |
| Exact trigger phrase provided | PASS | Captured verbatim in Action 1091 |
| Exact trigger phrase captured as ready | PASS | `final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_capture_ready` |
| Exact trigger phrase invoked by this action | BLOCK | Must not be invoked in this capture action |
| Live explicit trigger performed by this action | BLOCK | This action is documentation/decision-capture only |

## 5. Exact Trigger Phrase Capture Decision

`final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_capture_ready`

This means the exact trigger phrase has been provided and captured. It does not mean execution has occurred.

## 6. Decision Transition

```text
final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_capture_deferred
->
final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_capture_ready
```

## 7. Allowed Future Scope

A future action may consider the next gate/action only if all hard stops remain true.

Allowed future scope remains:

- Documentation/static gate only unless separately approved.
- Exact trigger phrase is captured but not invoked by Action 1091.
- Any future trigger invocation must still be explicit-trigger only.
- Any future trigger invocation must still require operator presence.
- Any future trigger invocation must still require Avanza already manually opened/logged in by user.
- Any future trigger invocation must still require BankID/2FA already manually handled by user.
- Any future trigger invocation must still require account and instrument manually verified by user.
- Any future trigger invocation must still use existing Action 1084 trigger.
- Any future trigger invocation must still use existing Action 1079 action.
- Any future trigger invocation must still use existing Action 1073 wrapper only.
- Any future trigger invocation must still use only the approved six-method runner boundary.
- Any future trigger invocation must read only required visible order-form state.
- Any future trigger invocation may fill only approved amount/price fields.
- Any future trigger invocation may read total.
- Any future trigger invocation may capture evidence.
- Any future trigger invocation must stop before Granska köp.
- No Granska köp click.
- No review modal.
- No final confirm.
- No Bekräfta köp/sälj.
- No submit/order placement.
- No credentials/session handling.
- No cookies/localStorage/sessionStorage handling.
- No unattended operation.
- No automatic UI/routes/provider/scanner/package-script trigger.
- Abort on mismatch/uncertainty.

Approved values remain:

| Field | Approved value |
| --- | --- |
| Account | Valentin Labs KF |
| Instrument | GameStop |
| Order mode | Avancerad/Limit |
| Side | Buy-only |
| Amount | 427,26 SEK |
| Price | 21,98 USD |
| Total | 438,05 SEK or otherwise under 1,000 SEK cap |

Approved runner boundary remains:

- `verifyVisibleOrderFormState`
- `fillAmountField`
- `fillPriceField`
- `readTotalAmount`
- `captureEvidence`
- `stopBeforeReview`

## 10. Status Meanings

- `ready_for_final_live_execute_attempt` does not mean execution occurred.
- `final_live_execute_attempt_plan_created` does not mean order placement.
- `ready_for_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation` does not mean execution occurred.
- `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_plan_created` does not mean order placement.
- `ready_for_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger` does not mean execution occurred.
- `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_plan_created` does not mean order placement.
- `final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_capture_ready` does not mean execution occurred.

## 11. Result Status

`first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_capture_ready`

## 12. Recommended Next Action

`Action 1092 — Add Final Live Execute Attempt Exact Trigger Phrase Final Gate`

Reason: after the exact trigger phrase is captured, the next step should add a final gate before any exact trigger phrase invocation or explicit final live execute attempt trigger can be considered.

Action 1092 must still not place an order and must still not click Granska köp.

Do not recommend a live attempt yet. Do not run the trigger yet.

## 13. Progress Update

| Area | Current readiness |
| --- | --- |
| Ture production/data-health | 95-97% |
| Market-window live dry-run | 92-95% |
| Semi-auto agent foundation | 98-99% |
| Semi-auto Avanza/browser-agent readiness | 99-100% |
| Real browser automation readiness | 100% |
| First Avanza fill-only POC readiness | 100% |
| Full-auto readiness | 10-15% deferred |
| Total Ture toward semi-auto MVP | 99-100% |

Full-auto remains explicitly deferred. Human-only final decision remains mandatory.

## Action 1094 Follow-Up - Final Live Execute Attempt Exact Trigger Phrase Invocation Checklist

Action 1094 added the final live execute attempt exact trigger phrase invocation checklist as documentation/checklist only. The exact trigger phrase remains captured from Action 1091, but it was not invoked or executed by Action 1094, and the trigger/action/wrapper/runner were not called.

- Action: Action 1094 — Add Final Live Execute Attempt Exact Trigger Phrase Invocation Checklist
- Decision: `final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_invocation_checklist_ready`
- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_invocation_checklist_added`
- Recommended next action: Action 1095 — Capture Final Live Execute Attempt Exact Trigger Phrase Invocation Checklist Confirmation
- Exact trigger phrase status: captured in Action 1091; not invoked by Action 1094.
- Trigger/action/wrapper/runner status: not invoked or called by Action 1094.
- Live execution status: no live invocation, no Avanza/browser/DOM/fill/click/review/final/submit/order-placement activity, and no Supabase/provider/scan/audit-writer invocation occurred.
- Fresh invocation checklist confirmation status: not captured in Action 1094; Action 1095 is the recommended confirmation-capture step.
- Denial harness status: skipped because denial harness scripts would execute live Supabase checks and are outside this documentation-only action.
