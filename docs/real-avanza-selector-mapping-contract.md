## Action 1066 Follow-Up - Live Invocation Execution Gate

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_live_invocation_execution_gate_added`.
- Added `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-live-invocation-execution-gate.md` as the final documentation/decision gate before adding any live invocation execute wrapper/action.
- Gate decision: `live_invocation_execution_gate_ready`. This means ready to add a live invocation execution action/wrapper; it does not mean execution has occurred.
- Gate basis: immediate pre-invocation confirmation ready, final operator GO captured, live invocation run attempt gate ready, live invocation attempt dry-run simulation passed, final live attempt preflight checklist ready, all hard stops active, and no live invocation performed.
- Allowed future execution scope remains explicit-trigger only, user present, browser already manually opened, Avanza already manually logged in, read only required visible order-form state, fill only approved amount/price fields, capture evidence, and stop before `Granska köp`.
- Mandatory aborts remain operator absent, browser/session not prepared, account/instrument mismatch, wrong side/order type, amount/price mismatch, total parse failure, cap exceeded, validation errors, modal open, final confirm visible, review click targeted/requested, submit/order placement requested, credential/session handling requested, or any uncertainty.
- This remains documentation/decision-gate only: no live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.

- Updated `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-immediate-pre-invocation-confirmation.md` to capture the exact operator-provided `IMMEDIATE PRE-INVOKE CONFIRMATION:` wording.
- Decision transition: `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_deferred` -> `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_ready`.
- Confirmation scope: operator present right now; Avanza open and logged in manually; BankID/2FA handled manually; Valentin Labs KF and GameStop still manually verified; buy-side Avancerad/Limit; amount 427,26 SEK; price 21,98 USD; total 438,05 SEK or otherwise under the 1,000 SEK cap; no modal open; no `Bekräfta köp/sälj` visible; `Granska köp` has not been clicked; browser can be closed immediately if anything is wrong; invocation must stop before `Granska köp`; abort on mismatch or uncertainty.
- Remaining hard stops: no `Granska köp`, no review modal, no `Bekräfta köp/sälj`, no submit/order placement, no unattended run, no credential/session handling, no sell/Stop Loss/Glidande, no cap above 1,000 SEK, and abort on mismatch/uncertainty.
- This remains documentation/decision-capture only: no live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.

- Current decision: `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_deferred`. The current instruction did not include the exact required immediate confirmation text.
- Required exact wording is documented for the next operator input.
- Carry-forward state remains: final preflight ready, final operator GO captured, live attempt gate ready, dry-run simulation passed, hard stops active, and no live invocation performed.
- No live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.

# Real Avanza Selector Mapping Contract

## Purpose

Action 1017 creates a pure/static Real Avanza selector mapping contract from
the Action 1016 human-led DOM/selector reconnaissance evidence.

This is not automation. This is not fill-only POC approval. This is not order
execution. The contract does not access Avanza, automate a browser, fill fields,
click buttons, submit orders, call routes, call Supabase, or mutate trades.

## Evidence Basis

- Evidence basis: Action 1016 operator-provided screenshots and browser
  DevTools observations.
- Code access to Avanza: not performed.
- Browser automation: not performed.
- Credentials/session tokens captured: no.
- Orders placed: no.
- Final confirmation clicked: no.

## Contract Module

- Module path: `lib/real-avanza-selector-mapping-contract.ts`.
- Test path: `tests/e2e/real-avanza-selector-mapping-contract.spec.ts`.
- Exported mapping: `realAvanzaSelectorMapping`.
- Lookup helper: `findRealAvanzaSelectorMappingEntry(...)`.
- Forbidden final selectors: `realAvanzaForbiddenFinalSelectors`.
- Required first future fill-only selectors:
  `realAvanzaFirstFillOnlyRequiredSelectorKeys`.
- Deferred selectors: `realAvanzaDeferredSelectorKeys`.
- Disallowed stable selector strategies:
  `realAvanzaDisallowedStableSelectorStrategies`.
- Preferred stable selector strategies:
  `realAvanzaPreferredStableSelectorStrategies`.

Classifications encoded:

- `read_only`
- `future_fill_candidate`
- `future_click_candidate`
- `forbidden_final_action`
- `human_verify_required`
- `deferred`

First POC behavior encoded:

- `allowed_read`
- `allowed_fill_after_approval`
- `allowed_click_after_separate_approval`
- `block`
- `forbidden`

## Selector Mapping Summary

| Area | Primary selector | First POC behavior | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Search open | `button[data-e2e="menuSearchButton"]` | `block` | Deferred search-stage click. |
| Search input | `input[data-e2e="search-query"]` | `block` | Deferred search-stage fill. |
| Search result | `a[href*="/aktier/om-aktien.html/194698/gamestop"]` | `block` | Avoid `#list-item-link-0`. |
| Instrument panel | `[data-e2e="orderMarketInfoPanel"]` | `allowed_read` | Required instrument verification. |
| Account selector | `button[aria-haspopup="listbox"]` | `allowed_read` | Human-verify account; never change account. |
| Selected account option | `aza-select-option[role="option"][aria-selected="true"]` | `allowed_read` | Read-only if account list is open. |
| Buy-state switch | `button[data-e2e="switchSideButton"][aria-label="Byt till sälj"]` | `allowed_read` | Confirms current side is buy. |
| Sell-state switch | `button[data-e2e="switchSideButton"][aria-label="Byt till köp"]` | `block` | First POC is buy-only. |
| Amount | `input[data-e2e="inputAmount"]` | `allowed_fill_after_approval` | Strong future amount-based fill candidate. |
| Quantity | `input[data-e2e="inputVolume"]` | `allowed_fill_after_approval` | Only if quantity mode is approved; no steppers or `Välj alla`. |
| Price | `input[data-e2e="inputPrice"]` | `allowed_fill_after_approval` | Verify currency label. |
| Limit/Avancerad | `input[type="radio"][value="Limit"]` | `allowed_read` | Required checked state. |
| Stop Loss | `mint-toggle-switch-option[data-e2e="selectOrderTypeOption_StopLossAbsolute"]` | `block` | Deferred. |
| Glidande | `mint-toggle-switch-option[data-e2e="selectOrderTypeOption_StopLossDelta"]` | `block` | Deferred. |
| Active indicator | `div[data-e2e="active-indicator"]` | `allowed_read` | Supplemental only. |
| Fees | `[data-e2e="totalFees"]` | `allowed_read` | Not cap source alone. |
| Total | `output[data-e2e="expandOrderAmount"]` | `allowed_read` | Primary cap verification field. |
| Expanded fees/FX | `aza-order-summary` | `allowed_read` | Review-stage read-only details. |
| Review buy | `button[data-e2e="orderButton"][data-mint-button-theme="buy"]` | `block` | Not final submit, but opens confirmation modal. |
| Review sell | `button[data-e2e="orderButton"][data-mint-button-theme="sell"]` | `block` | Sell/review deferred. |
| Confirmation modal | `form.order-screen-content.order-dialog` | `block` | Review-stage boundary. |
| Final confirm general | `button[data-e2e="confirmOrderButton"]` | `forbidden` | Hard stop. |
| Final confirm buy | `button[data-e2e="confirmOrderButton"][data-mint-button-theme="buy"]` | `forbidden` | Hard stop; `Bekräfta köp`. |
| Final confirm sell | `button[data-e2e="confirmOrderButton"][data-mint-button-theme="sell"]` | `forbidden` | Hard stop; `Bekräfta sälj`. |
| Cancel | `button[data-e2e="orderConfirmCancelLink"]` | `block` | Future review-stage safe-exit candidate only after approval. |

## Hard Forbidden Selectors

- `button[data-e2e="confirmOrderButton"]`
- `button[data-e2e="confirmOrderButton"][data-mint-button-theme="buy"]`
- `button[data-e2e="confirmOrderButton"][data-mint-button-theme="sell"]`

These are final broker submit actions. They must never be clicked by Ture or an
agent. Detection of these selectors is a hard stop, not an action target.

## First POC Implication

- First real Avanza POC is still not approved by this action.
- First future POC should be fill-only, buy-only, and require separate explicit
  approval.
- First future POC should stop before `Granska köp`.
- Review-modal click, cancel click, search-stage automation, sell side, Stop
  Loss, and Glidande remain deferred.
- Total amount readback must be used as the primary UI cap verification field.

## Test Coverage

`tests/e2e/real-avanza-selector-mapping-contract.spec.ts` verifies:

- all critical selector entries exist;
- final confirm general/buy/sell selectors are hard-stop forbidden;
- review buttons are not final submit but remain blocked for first POC;
- amount, quantity, and price are future fill candidates only after approval;
- total amount is read-only and required for cap verification;
- account selectors are read-only and human-verified;
- buy/sell side state is encoded;
- Avancerad/Limit state is required and read-only;
- Stop Loss, Glidande, and search-stage selectors are deferred;
- generated Angular ids/classes are disallowed as stable selector strategies;
- no final selector can ever be allowed;
- no first POC behavior permits review or confirm clicking;
- the module has no browser/fetch/Supabase/env/provider/route/audit imports.

## Result Status

`real_avanza_selector_mapping_contract_created`

## Recommended Next Action

Action 1018 - Add Selector Contract To Fill-Only Guard.

Reason: the next safe step is to make the max amount/final-submit guard aware
of the static selector contract, still without Avanza automation.
