## Action 1066 Follow-Up - Live Invocation Execution Gate

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_live_invocation_execution_gate_added`.
- Added `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-live-invocation-execution-gate.md` as the final documentation/decision gate before adding any live invocation execute wrapper/action.
- Gate decision: `live_invocation_execution_gate_ready`. This means ready to add a live invocation execution action/wrapper; it does not mean execution has occurred.
- Gate basis: immediate pre-invocation confirmation ready, final operator GO captured, live invocation run attempt gate ready, live invocation attempt dry-run simulation passed, final live attempt preflight checklist ready, all hard stops active, and no live invocation performed.
- Allowed future execution scope remains explicit-trigger only, user present, browser already manually opened, Avanza already manually logged in, read only required visible order-form state, fill only approved amount/price fields, capture evidence, and stop before `Granska köp`.
- Mandatory aborts remain operator absent, browser/session not prepared, account/instrument mismatch, wrong side/order type, amount/price mismatch, total parse failure, cap exceeded, validation errors, modal open, final confirm visible, review click targeted/requested, submit/order placement requested, credential/session handling requested, or any uncertainty.
- This remains documentation/decision-gate only: no live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.
- Recommended next action: Action 1067 - Add Live Invocation Execute Wrapper.

- Updated `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-immediate-pre-invocation-confirmation.md` to capture the exact operator-provided `IMMEDIATE PRE-INVOKE CONFIRMATION:` wording.
- Decision transition: `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_deferred` -> `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_ready`.
- Confirmation scope: operator present right now; Avanza open and logged in manually; BankID/2FA handled manually; Valentin Labs KF and GameStop still manually verified; buy-side Avancerad/Limit; amount 427,26 SEK; price 21,98 USD; total 438,05 SEK or otherwise under the 1,000 SEK cap; no modal open; no `Bekräfta köp/sälj` visible; `Granska köp` has not been clicked; browser can be closed immediately if anything is wrong; invocation must stop before `Granska köp`; abort on mismatch or uncertainty.
- Remaining hard stops: no `Granska köp`, no review modal, no `Bekräfta köp/sälj`, no submit/order placement, no unattended run, no credential/session handling, no sell/Stop Loss/Glidande, no cap above 1,000 SEK, and abort on mismatch/uncertainty.
- This remains documentation/decision-capture only: no live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.

- Current decision: `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_deferred`. The current instruction did not include the exact required immediate confirmation text.
- Required exact wording is documented for the next operator input.
- Carry-forward state remains: final preflight ready, final operator GO captured, live attempt gate ready, dry-run simulation passed, hard stops active, and no live invocation performed.
- No live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.

- Recommended next action: Action 1028 - Capture First Fill-Only POC Manual
  Approval.

## Purpose

Action 1026 adds the operator runbook for the first future real Avanza
fill-only POC.

This is not the real run. This is not implementation. This is not order
execution. It does not access Avanza, launch or control a browser, query the
DOM, fill fields, click buttons, open `Granska köp`, click `Bekräfta köp`,
click `Bekräfta sälj`, submit an order, call providers/routes/scans, call
Supabase, mutate trades/stats/PnL, or change `.env.local`.

Final confirmation remains forbidden.

## Required Approval Before Use

This runbook cannot be used for a real POC until explicit operator approval
text is captured and checked against the approval contract.

The approval must match the locked scope:

- Buy-only.
- Avancerad/Limit.
- Amount-based.
- Cap less than or equal to 1,000 SEK.
- User present.
- User manually logs in.
- User manually opens Avanza.
- User manually opens the correct instrument/order form unless a search stage
  is later separately approved.
- Stop before `Granska köp`.
- No review modal.
- No final confirmation.
- No order placement.

## Roles

Operator/user:

- Logs in manually.
- Opens Avanza manually.
- Opens the correct instrument/order form manually.
- Verifies account.
- Verifies instrument.
- Stays present for the entire run.
- Can kill, close, or cancel the browser/session at any time.

Ture/future agent:

- May only perform an approved fill-only action in a future separately approved
  run action.
- Must not click review.
- Must not click confirm.
- Must not submit.
- Must stop before `Granska köp`.

Codex:

- Does not access Avanza.
- Does not run browser automation against Avanza.
- Does not fill fields.
- Does not click.
- Documents implementation and safety artifacts only.

## Pre-Run Checklist

- Explicit approval text is present.
- Approval contract passes.
- Implementation stub returns safe readiness.
- Dry-run harness passes.
- Fill-only guard passes.
- Selector policy passes.
- Cap is less than or equal to 1,000 SEK.
- Correct account is preselected.
- Correct instrument page/order form is open.
- Buy side is visible.
- Avancerad/Limit is selected.
- Total amount selector is available:
  `output[data-e2e="expandOrderAmount"]`.
- Final confirm forbidden selector is present in the contract:
  `button[data-e2e="confirmOrderButton"]`.
- Browser/session is stable.
- Screenshots/evidence plan is ready.
- Kill switch/cancel plan is ready.

## Locked POC Scope

- Buy only.
- Avancerad/Limit only.
- Amount-based only.
- No quantity mode unless separately approved.
- No search stage unless separately approved.
- No sell.
- No Stop Loss.
- No Glidande.
- No review modal.
- No final submit.

## Intended Future Fill-Only Sequence

This sequence is future and conditional. It is not performed by this action.

1. Operator manually logs in to Avanza.
2. Operator manually opens the correct instrument/order form.
3. Future agent verifies the instrument selector.
4. Future agent verifies account read-only.
5. Future agent verifies buy side.
6. Future agent verifies Avancerad/Limit.
7. Future agent fills `Belopp i SEK` under cap.
8. Future agent fills `Kurs i USD`.
9. Future agent reads total amount.
10. Future agent verifies total is less than or equal to cap.
11. Future agent stops before `Granska köp`.
12. Operator confirms no review click happened.
13. Operator closes/cancels manually if needed.

## Hard Stops

Abort immediately if any of these occur:

- `Granska köp` would be clicked.
- `Granska sälj` appears.
- Confirmation modal opens.
- `Bekräfta köp` appears.
- `Bekräfta sälj` appears.
- Final selector is targeted:
  `button[data-e2e="confirmOrderButton"]`.
- Account mismatch.
- Instrument mismatch.
- Side is not buy.
- Order type is not Limit.
- Total cannot be parsed.
- Total exceeds cap.
- Validation errors appear.
- UI changed materially.
- User/operator is not present.
- Any uncertainty exists.

## Evidence Capture Checklist

- After-fill screenshot.
- Approval decision output.
- Implementation stub decision output.
- Dry-run harness decision output.
- Guard decision output.
- Selector policy output.
- Cap decision output.

- Visible Avancerad/Limit.
- Visible amount.
- Visible price.
- Visible total.
- No review click statement.
- No modal opened statement.
- No final click statement.
- No order placed statement.

## Pass/Fail Criteria

Pass only if all of these are true:

- Approved scope matched.
- Amount and price were filled as intended.
- Total was parsed and less than or equal to cap.
- No review click occurred.
- No modal opened.
- No final confirm occurred.
- No order was placed.
- Evidence was captured.

Fail or safety fail if any of these are true:

- Any forbidden click occurs.
- Modal opens unexpectedly.
- Total exceeds cap.
- Final selector appears as target.
- Account, instrument, side, or order type mismatches.
- Operator intervenes due uncertainty.

## Abort/Kill Switch

- Operator may close the tab, window, or browser.
- Operator may cancel manually.
- Operator may stop the run immediately.
- No automated recovery is allowed.
- If any uncertainty exists, abort and document the reason.

  references and no executable Avanza, browser, broker, automatic-submit,
  fetch, Supabase, environment, service-role, provider, route, scan, audit
  writer, click, locator, goto, or fill code.
- Automatic-mode safety scan returned expected human-confirmation and
  forbidden-action policy references only.
