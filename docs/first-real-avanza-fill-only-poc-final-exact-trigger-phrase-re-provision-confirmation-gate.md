# First Real Avanza Fill-Only POC Final Exact Trigger Phrase Re-Provision Confirmation Gate

## Purpose

This document adds the final exact trigger phrase re-provision confirmation gate.

This is not a live run. It does not access Avanza, launch or control a browser, query DOM, fill fields, click anything, open a review modal, submit or place an order, handle credentials/session data, mutate trades/stats/PnL, invoke or execute the exact trigger phrase, or call the trigger/action/wrapper/runner.

This documents that the exact trigger phrase itself must now be explicitly provided again in a separate future request before invocation can be considered.

Ready never means execution occurred.

## Confirmation Gate Decision

`final_exact_trigger_phrase_re_provision_confirmation_gate_ready`

This means the final exact trigger phrase re-provision confirmation gate is ready for adding a future final exact trigger phrase separate-request gate/checklist. It does not mean execution has occurred.

Do not use `final_exact_trigger_phrase_re_provision_confirmation_gate_blocked` unless repository state reveals a real blocker.

## Allowed Future Scope

Only the following future scope is allowed unless separately approved:

- Documentation/static final exact trigger phrase separate-request gate/checklist or readiness action only unless separately approved.
- Exact trigger phrase is historically captured but not invoked by Action 1116.
- Final exact trigger phrase re-provision confirmation is captured but does not execute anything.
- Trigger/action/wrapper/runner are not invoked by Action 1116.
- Exact trigger phrase itself must now be explicitly provided again in a separate future request before invocation can be considered.
- Any future invocation must still be explicit-trigger only.
- Any future invocation must still require operator presence.
- Any future invocation must still require Avanza already manually opened/logged in by user.
- Any future invocation must still require BankID/2FA already manually handled by user.

## Result Status

`first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_exact_trigger_phrase_re_provision_confirmation_gate_added`

## Recommended Next Action

`Action 1117 — Add Final Exact Trigger Phrase Separate-Request Gate`

After the final exact trigger phrase re-provision confirmation gate is ready, the next step may add a final exact trigger phrase separate-request gate that prepares the final future request where the exact trigger phrase itself is explicitly provided again. This still must not place an order, must still not click Granska köp, and must not itself perform a live run.

Action 1117 must still not place an order and must still not click Granska köp. Do not recommend a live attempt yet. Do not run the trigger yet.

## Progress Update

- Ture production/data-health: 95-97%
- Market-window live dry-run: 92-95%
