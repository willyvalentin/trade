## Action 1066 Follow-Up - Live Invocation Execution Gate

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_live_invocation_execution_gate_added`.
- Added `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-live-invocation-execution-gate.md` as the final documentation/decision gate before adding any live invocation execute wrapper/action.
- Gate decision: `live_invocation_execution_gate_ready`. This means ready to add a live invocation execution action/wrapper; it does not mean execution has occurred.
- Gate basis: immediate pre-invocation confirmation ready, final operator GO captured, live invocation run attempt gate ready, live invocation attempt dry-run simulation passed, final live attempt preflight checklist ready, all hard stops active, and no live invocation performed.
- Allowed future execution scope remains explicit-trigger only, user present, browser already manually opened, Avanza already manually logged in, read only required visible order-form state, fill only approved amount/price fields, capture evidence, and stop before `Granska köp`.
- Mandatory aborts remain operator absent, browser/session not prepared, account/instrument mismatch, wrong side/order type, amount/price mismatch, total parse failure, cap exceeded, validation errors, modal open, final confirm visible, review click targeted/requested, submit/order placement requested, credential/session handling requested, or any uncertainty.
- This remains documentation/decision-gate only: no live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.
- Recommended next action: Action 1067 - Add Live Invocation Execute Wrapper.

- Updated `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-immediate-pre-invocation-confirmation.md` to capture the exact operator-provided `IMMEDIATE PRE-INVOKE CONFIRMATION:` wording.
- Decision transition: `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_deferred` -> `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_ready`.
- Confirmation scope: operator present right now; Avanza open and logged in manually; BankID/2FA handled manually; Valentin Labs KF and GameStop still manually verified; buy-side Avancerad/Limit; amount 427,26 SEK; price 21,98 USD; total 438,05 SEK or otherwise under the 1,000 SEK cap; no modal open; no `Bekräfta köp/sälj` visible; `Granska köp` has not been clicked; browser can be closed immediately if anything is wrong; invocation must stop before `Granska köp`; abort on mismatch or uncertainty.
- Remaining hard stops: no `Granska köp`, no review modal, no `Bekräfta köp/sälj`, no submit/order placement, no unattended run, no credential/session handling, no sell/Stop Loss/Glidande, no cap above 1,000 SEK, and abort on mismatch/uncertainty.
- This remains documentation/decision-capture only: no live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.

- Current decision: `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_deferred`. The current instruction did not include the exact required immediate confirmation text.
- Required exact wording is documented for the next operator input.
- Carry-forward state remains: final preflight ready, final operator GO captured, live attempt gate ready, dry-run simulation passed, hard stops active, and no live invocation performed.
- No live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.

  state contract and remains compatible with `not_approved_yet`,
  `approved_for_stub_only`, and future real dry-run approval states.
- Recommended next action: Action 1023 - Add First Fill-Only POC Local
  Simulation Report.

## Purpose

Action 1021 adds a local/static dry-run harness stub for the first real Avanza
fill-only POC decision chain.

This is not real Avanza automation. This is not approval to run the real POC.
This is not order execution. The harness does not access Avanza, query the DOM,
fill fields, click buttons, submit orders, call providers, call routes, call
Supabase, or mutate trades/stats/PnL.

## Implementation

- Helper path:
  `lib/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-dry-run-harness.ts`.
- Test path:
  `tests/e2e/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-dry-run-harness.spec.ts`.
- The harness imports the existing pure fill-only guard and selector policy.
- The harness accepts a static payload, static selector-readiness snapshot, and
  static operator-approval snapshot.
- The harness returns a pure decision object with status, blocked reasons,
  parsed total amount, evidence requirements, forbidden selectors, guard
  status, selector policy status, and real-action flags.
- The harness has no runtime browser, DOM, Avanza, fetch, Supabase, provider,
  route, audit-writer, env, service-role, or broker integration.

## Decision Model

- `not_approved`: approval is missing.
- `approved_for_stub_only`: the local/static simulation is safe and all guard
  checks pass.
- `blocked`: a non-action safety prerequisite is missing or invalid.
- `failed_safety`: review click, final selector, generated selector strategy,
  or any real-action flag is requested.

## Safety Flags

The harness always returns these real-action flags as false:

- `real_avanza_access: false`
- `browser_automation: false`
- `dom_querying: false`
- `field_filling: false`
- `clicking: false`
- `submit: false`
- `review_click_allowed: false`
- `final_confirm_allowed: false`

## Guarded Conditions

The harness evaluates:

- Approval state.
- Max cap.
- Selector readiness.
- Total amount selector availability.
- Total amount SEK parsing.
- Total amount less than or equal to cap.
- Account human verification.
- Instrument human verification.
- Price/currency human verification.
- Buy side.
- Avancerad/Limit order type.
- Validation errors.
- Review click request.
- Final selector target.
- Generated selector strategy.
- Existing fill-only guard result.

## Test Coverage

New test file:

`tests/e2e/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-dry-run-harness.spec.ts`

The tests cover:

- Missing approval returns `not_approved`.
- Safe local-only simulation returns `approved_for_stub_only`.
- All real-action flags remain false.
- Cap above 1,000 SEK blocks.
- Missing total amount selector metadata blocks.
- Unparseable total amount blocks.
- Total above cap blocks.
- Automatic submit blocks through the fill-only guard.
- Non-buy side blocks.
- Non-Limit/Avancerad order type blocks.
- Missing account, instrument, or price/currency human verification blocks.
- Validation errors block.
- Review click request fails safety.
- Final confirm selector target fails safety.
- Generated selector strategy fails safety.
- Evidence requirements are exposed.
- Forbidden selectors are exposed.
- Module source remains pure and local.

## Result Status

`first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_dry_run_harness_stub_added`

## Recommended Next Action

Action 1022 - Add First Fill-Only POC Approval State Contract.

Reason: before any real dry-run can be approved, approval state should be
encoded as a pure contract, separate from local stub simulation.

## Validation Results

- New dry-run harness tests passed: 20/20.
- Focused existing guard/selector/safety stack passed: 71/71 across the new
  harness tests, real Avanza fill-only guard contract tests, selector mapping
  contract tests, human-final-confirmation guard tests, browser automation
  safety boundary tests, and sandbox selector-stability tests.
- The first sandboxed Playwright run was blocked by local web-server bind
  `EPERM` on port 3010; the focused Playwright runs passed after escalation for
  local server binding only.
- `./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit` passed.
- `npm run lint` passed with the known `app/trade-app.tsx` Babel deopt note.
- Optional runtime denial harness import check reported
  `runtime-denial-script-absent`.
- Audit writer runtime path import search returned no app/components/hooks
  matches.
- Harness-specific executable safety scan returned no forbidden browser,
  Avanza, DOM, fetch, Supabase, env, service-role, provider, route, scan,
  audit-writer, click, locator, goto, or broker imports.
- Route invocation, UI/app-shell audit writer import, market-loop/scanner,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_*SERVICE*`, service-role leakage, automatic-mode, dead-doc/path,
  status string, and next-action scans passed or returned expected docs-only,
  test-only, existing app, selector-literal, or policy references without
  invoking runtime behavior or printing secrets.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Touched-file trailing whitespace scan returned no matches.
- `find docs -type f -size 0` returned no output.
- `.env.local` diff check returned no output.
