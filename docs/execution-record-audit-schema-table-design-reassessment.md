# Execution Record Audit Schema/Table Design Reassessment

## Purpose

Action 730 reassesses `docs/execution-record-audit-schema-table-design.md` after Action 729.

This reassessment verifies that the audit schema/table design is complete as a design artifact, remains non-proof, does not create or apply a migration, does not generate types, does not implement writer/route/write behavior, and preserves all safety boundaries.

No runtime code changes were made for this reassessment.

## Current Design Inventory

The design includes:

- Proposed table identity for `public.execution_record_audit_events`.
- Column matrix.
- Constraints/indexes.
- Idempotency model.
- Duplicate-prevention model.
- Evidence/provenance model.
- RLS/security considerations.
- Generated type requirements.
- Migration requirements.
- Audit writer relationship.
- Production route relationship.
- Dry-run diagnostics relationship.
- Open questions.
- Proof artifact gaps.
- Risk registry.

The design is sufficient as a schema/table design artifact. It is not schema proof.

## Documentation-Only Verification

Verified:

- The design states it is not schema proof.
- The design states it is not remote table proof.
- The design does not create or apply a migration.
- The design does not generate types.
- The design does not implement writer, route, or write path behavior.
- The design does not add runtime code.
- The design does not add Supabase/localStorage writes.
- The design does not add audit append behavior.
- The design does not trigger broker/Avanza/automatic behavior.

No migration file, generated type file, audit writer, audit route, route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit append execution, downstream action, broker/order action, Avanza/browser action, or automatic mode was added.

## Table Identity Verification

Verified:

- Proposed table name: `execution_record_audit_events`.
- Proposed namespace: `public`.
- Purpose: append-only audit events for future execution-record persistence and audit-writer activity.
- Relation to execution records: audit rows should reference an execution record when a persisted execution record exists.
- Relation to future audit writer: writer may target the table only after schema, migration, generated types, RLS/security, server-only, service-role, route/auth, idempotency, duplicate-prevention, and evidence/provenance proof artifacts are complete.
- Ownership assumptions remain design-only and pending RLS/security and service-role proof.

The table identity is proposed, not applied.

## Column Design Verification

Verified the column matrix covers:

- `id`.
- `execution_record_id`.
- `event_type`.
- `event_source`.
- `event_status`.
- `event_payload`.
- `evidence_payload`.
- `actor_type`.
- `actor_id`.
- `source_system`.
- `source_fingerprint`.
- `idempotency_key`.
- `duplicate_prevention_key`.
- `created_at`.
- `occurred_at`.
- `schema_version`.
- `writer_version`.
- `request_id`.
- `trace_id`.
- `metadata`.

For each listed column, the design documents:

- Type.
- Required/nullable semantics.
- Purpose.
- Source.
- Validation requirement.
- Risk if wrong.

The matrix is complete enough for design review. It does not create generated types or database columns.

## Constraints/Indexes Verification

Verified coverage for:

- Primary key on `id`.
- Execution-record relationship and foreign-key consideration.
- Idempotency uniqueness.
- Duplicate-prevention uniqueness/strategy.
- `event_type` and `event_status` index/check considerations.
- `execution_record_id` index.
- `created_at` index.
- `source_fingerprint` index.
- Risk if constraints are missing.

The design correctly keeps foreign-key and duplicate-prevention scope as open proof/design decisions rather than assuming remote schema details.

## Idempotency/Evidence/Security Verification

Verified coverage for:

- Idempotency key source.
- Duplicate-prevention key source.
- Retry behavior.
- Unknown status handling.
- Manual review handling.
- Evidence payload purpose.
- Event payload purpose.
- Actor/source metadata.
- Timestamp/source clock.
- No local-only truth.
- Broker/Avanza assumptions disallowed unless separately evidenced.
- Secrets/PII risk noted.
- RLS/security deferred as a separate proof requirement.
- Client writes must be blocked later.
- Service-role/server-only proof is required later.

The design does not prove idempotency, evidence provenance, RLS/security, server-only, service-role, or client-bundle safety.

## Generated Types/Migration Verification

Verified:

- Generated audit table types are required later.
- Generated execution-record types are not enough.
- Type drift blocks writer implementation.
- Migration file is required later.
- Remote migration application proof is required later.
- Rollback or correction plan is required later.
- No migration/type generation happened in Action 729.

The design does not create a migration file, does not apply a migration, and does not generate Supabase types.

## Relationship Verification

Verified:

- Audit writer cannot exist until schema/table, migration, generated types, RLS/security, server-only, service-role, route/auth, idempotency, duplicate-prevention, and evidence/provenance proof exists.
- Writer must validate input shape against schema and generated types.
- Writer success does not authorize downstream behavior.
- Production insert route must not implicitly write audit events.
- Insert success is not an audit writer trigger.
- Production route and audit writer remain separate boundaries.
- Dry-run diagnostics may use schema as a hypothetical target only.
- Dry-run/dev preview is not schema proof.

The design preserves separation between audit evidence capture, execution-record insertion, and downstream action authority.

## Remaining Proof Gaps

Still required:

- Schema design approval.
- Migration file.
- Remote migration application proof.
- Generated audit types proof.
- RLS policy proof.
- Server-only/service-role proof.
- Route/auth proof.
- Idempotency test proof.
- Duplicate prevention test proof.
- Evidence/provenance proof.
- Audit writer implementation still absent.
- Audit route/write path still absent.
- Production insert route/write path still absent.

Dry-run diagnostics, dev-preview output, and schema/table design do not close these gaps.

## Candidate Next Actions

A. Create Audit Table Migration Design.

B. Create Audit Table Generated Types Plan.

C. Create Production Insert Route Implementation Design.

D. Create Audit Append Writer Actual Implementation Design.

## Recommended Next Action

Action 731 - Create Audit Table Migration Design.

The migration design should remain documentation-only and should define proposed SQL, environment targeting, remote verification, RLS inspection, rollback/correction planning, and proof requirements without creating or applying a migration.

## Risk Assessment

- Schema design mistaken for applied migration.
- Table assumed to exist remotely.
- Generated types assumed to exist.
- RLS assumed safe.
- Idempotency incomplete.
- Duplicate writes possible.
- Payload stores secrets/PII.
- Downstream authority accidentally implied.
- Production insert route coupled too early.
- Audit writer built before proof.
- Docs accidentally zeroed by bulk operations.

Mitigation: keep this reassessment documentation-only, require migration/type/security proof before implementation, and preserve all no-write/no-authority boundaries.

## Verification

Required Action 730 verification:

- `git diff --check`
- `find docs -type f -size 0`

Expected result:

- `git diff --check` passes.
- `find docs -type f -size 0` returns no files.

No runtime tests are required for this documentation-only reassessment.


## Action 731 - Audit Table Migration Design

Action 731 added docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-design.md as a documentation-only migration design for future public.execution_record_audit_events. The design translates the Action 729 schema/table design into proposed migration identity, intended operations, a clearly marked draft/non-applied SQL skeleton, idempotency and duplicate-prevention migration details, evidence/provenance fields, RLS/security considerations, generated type requirements, remote verification requirements, rollback/backout considerations, relationships to the audit writer, dry-run diagnostics, and production insert route, open questions, remaining proof artifacts, risks, and next action.

The migration design is not a migration file, is not migration proof, is not schema proof, does not prove the table exists remotely, does not apply anything, and does not generate Supabase types. Dry-run/dev-preview diagnostics may reference the proposed migration target only as hypothetical and remain not migration proof or write approval.

No runtime behavior was changed for Action 731. No migration file, migration application, generated types, audit writer, audit route, production route, route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, audit append execution, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI update beyond existing diagnostics display, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, or remote schema assumption was added. Recommended next action: Action 732 - Reassess Audit Table Migration Design.


## Action 732 - Audit Table Migration Design Reassessment

Action 732 added docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-design-reassessment.md as a documentation-only reassessment of the Action 731 audit table migration design. The reassessment verifies that docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-design.md remains a non-proof migration-design artifact for future public.execution_record_audit_events and covers proposed migration identity, path pattern, target schema/table, dependency on execution_records, intended SQL operations, draft SQL skeleton, idempotency and duplicate-prevention design, evidence/provenance design, RLS/security considerations, generated type requirements, remote verification requirements, rollback/backout considerations, relationships to the audit writer, dry-run diagnostics, and production insert route, open questions, proof gaps, and risks.

The reassessment confirms the migration design is not a migration file, not migration proof, not schema proof, not remote table proof, does not create or apply a migration, does not generate types, does not implement writer/route/write behavior, and does not close migration, generated-type, RLS/security, server-only/service-role, route/auth, idempotency, duplicate-prevention, or evidence/provenance proof gaps.

No runtime behavior was changed for Action 732. No migration file, migration application, generated types, audit writer, audit route, production route, route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, audit append execution, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI update beyond existing diagnostics display, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, or remote schema assumption was added. Recommended next action: Action 733 - Create Audit Table Migration File.


## Action 733 - Audit Table Migration File

Action 733 added supabase/migrations/20260615000000_create_execution_record_audit_events.sql as the local Supabase migration file for future public.execution_record_audit_events. The migration creates the audit event table with execution_record_id, event type/source/status fields, JSONB event/evidence/metadata payloads, actor/source/request/trace fields, idempotency and duplicate-prevention fields, timestamps, schema/writer version fields, non-empty checks for required text values, event_status allowlist, idempotency uniqueness, partial duplicate-prevention uniqueness, execution_record_id/event_type/event_status/created_at/source_fingerprint indexes, FK reference to public.execution_records(id), and safety comments.

The migration file is local only and was not applied. Remote table proof remains absent, generated audit table types were not generated, RLS/security/server-only/service-role proof remains missing, and no audit writer, audit route, production route, route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write behavior, audit append implementation, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, or remote schema assumption was added. The migration intentionally creates no permissive client write policy and leaves RLS/policy proof as a blocker before writer/route implementation.

Validation requested for Action 733 includes tsc, lint, git diff check, zero-byte docs check, and e2e. Recommended next action: Action 734 - Reassess Audit Table Migration File.


## Action 734 - Audit Table Migration File Reassessment

Action 734 added docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-file-reassessment.md as a documentation-only reassessment of the local audit table migration file supabase/migrations/20260615000000_create_execution_record_audit_events.sql. The reassessment verifies the migration file creates public.execution_record_audit_events locally with the expected columns, JSONB payloads, FK to public.execution_records(id), idempotency uniqueness, partial duplicate-prevention uniqueness, indexes, status/check constraints, safety comments, no permissive client write policies, and RLS/policy proof left as a blocker.

The reassessment confirms the migration file exists locally only, was not applied, does not prove the remote table exists, does not generate audit table types, does not prove RLS/security/server-only/service-role/route-auth safety, and does not create audit writer, audit route, production route, route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write behavior, audit append implementation, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, or downstream authority. Dry-run/dev-preview diagnostics remain not proof.

Action 733 validation evidence remains: tsc passed, lint passed, git diff check passed, zero-byte docs check passed, sandbox e2e hit the known EPERM 0.0.0.0:3010 blocker before app logic, and escalated full e2e passed 139/139. Recommended next action: Action 735 - Create Audit Table Migration Application Verification Plan.

## Action 751 - Audit Writer Implementation Readiness Matrix

- Added docs/execution-record-audit-writer-implementation-readiness-matrix.md as the documentation-only readiness matrix for any future execution-record audit writer implementation.
- The matrix consolidates proof gates for schema/table design, table migration file, migration application proof, remote table proof, generated audit table types, RLS policy migration file, RLS application and remote policy proof, anon/client denial proof, server-only/service-role proof, route/auth proof, idempotency, duplicate prevention, evidence/provenance, payload validation, downstream no-authority, audit writer design, audit route contract design, production insert separation, broker/Avanza no-action, and automatic-mode disabled proof.
- Current readiness is explicitly blocked for audit writer implementation, audit route implementation, and production write-path implementation because required proof artifacts remain missing. No migration was applied, no migration file was edited, no Supabase migration/mutation/type-generation commands were run, no generated type files were modified, no RLS policies were created/applied, no service-role code/client was added, and no writer, route, route call, insert path, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit append, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation, UI notification, broker behavior, Avanza behavior, or automatic mode was added.
- Recommended next action: Action 752 - Reassess Audit Writer Implementation Readiness Matrix.

## Action 752 - Audit Writer Implementation Readiness Matrix Reassessment

- Added docs/execution-record-audit-writer-implementation-readiness-matrix-reassessment.md as the documentation-only reassessment of docs/execution-record-audit-writer-implementation-readiness-matrix.md.
- The reassessment verifies the matrix remains documentation-only, non-proof, no-runtime, and no-write; verifies audit writer implementation readiness, audit route implementation readiness, and production write-path readiness are blocked; and confirms missing proof artifacts remain the blocker reason.
- It verifies readiness gate coverage, proof dependency order, critical blockers, false-positive readiness traps, downstream authority protections, relationships to existing docs, risk posture, and the next proof-producing action. No migration was applied, no migration file was edited, no Supabase migration/mutation/type-generation commands were run, no generated type files were modified, no RLS policies were created/applied, no service-role code/client was added, and no writer, route, route call, insert path, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit append, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation, UI notification, broker behavior, Avanza behavior, or automatic mode was added.
- Recommended next action: Action 753 - Apply Audit Table Migration Manually.

## Action 753 - Audit Table Migration Application Blocked

- Added docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-application-proof.md as the Action 753 migration-application proof/blocker record.
- Action 753 was blocked before any Supabase command or migration application because the intended Supabase project/environment was not explicitly confirmed by the operator; target environment and approval remain required before migration status, migration apply, or remote verification commands may run.
- No migration was applied, no migration file was edited, no Supabase migration/mutation/type-generation commands were run, no generated type files were modified, no RLS policies were created/applied, no proof artifacts were generated under docs/proofs, and remote table/RLS/policy proof remains missing.
- No service-role code/client, audit writer, audit route, route call, insert path, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit append, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation, UI notification, broker behavior, Avanza behavior, or automatic mode was added.
- Recommended next action: Action 754 - Resolve Audit Table Migration Application Blocker.

## Action 754 - Audit Table Migration Application Blocker Resolution

- Added docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-application-blocker-resolution.md as the documentation-only blocker-resolution checklist for Action 753.
- The blocker remains unresolved because no explicit Supabase project name, project ref, environment type, database target, approving operator, approval timestamp, backup/snapshot decision, or rollback/backout acknowledgement was provided in the current operator context.
- No migration was applied, no migration file was edited, no Supabase migration/status/mutation/type-generation commands were run, no generated type files were modified, no RLS policies were created/applied, and no remote table/RLS/policy proof or docs/proofs command artifacts were created.
- No service-role code/client, audit writer, audit route, route call, insert path, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit append, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation, UI notification, broker behavior, Avanza behavior, or automatic mode was added.
- Recommended next action: Action 755 - Request/Record Audit Table Migration Target Approval.

## Action 755 - Audit Table Migration Target Approval Record

- Added docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-target-approval-record.md as the documentation-only target approval record/template for the audit table migration.
- The approval record keeps migration application blocked because Supabase project name/ref, environment type, database target, approving operator, approval timestamp, backup/snapshot decision, rollback/backout acknowledgement, command operator, verification reviewer, and exact approval statement are not recorded.
- No migration was applied, no migration file was edited, no Supabase status/migration/mutation/type-generation commands were run, no generated type files were modified, no RLS policies were created/applied, and no remote table/RLS/policy proof or docs/proofs command artifacts were created.
- No service-role code/client, audit writer, audit route, route call, insert path, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit append, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation, UI notification, broker behavior, Avanza behavior, or automatic mode was added.
- Recommended next action: Action 756 - Provide Audit Table Migration Target Approval.

## Action 775 - Schema/Table Design Reassessment After Failed Apply

- The failed apply does not invalidate the audit table schema design, but it exposes an unproven prerequisite: remote `public.execution_records`.
- Local migration `20260614000000_create_execution_records.sql` creates the prerequisite table and remains pending remotely.
- The FK strategy should remain blocked until the prerequisite is approved, applied, and proven or until a separate action explicitly redesigns the FK strategy.
- No migration apply, migration edit, remote SQL, type generation, generated type edit, writer, route, route call, or runtime write path was added.
- Status: `audit_migration_apply_failure_resolution_documented`.
- Recommended next action: Action 776 - Identify Execution Records Migration Dependency For Audit Table.
