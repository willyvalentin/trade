## Action 1060 Follow-Up - Live Invocation Run Attempt Gate

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_live_invocation_run_attempt_gate_added`.
- Gate decision: `live_invocation_run_attempt_gate_ready`. This means ready to add a live invocation attempt action/wrapper; it does not mean the live invocation has occurred.
- Gate basis: final operator GO captured; final pre-live review ready; final live invocation operator checklist ready; final live invocation wrapper simulation passed; fresh pre-run evidence ready; all hard stops remain active.
- Allowed future attempt remains explicit-trigger-only, user-present, manually opened/logged-in Avanza, read-only visible state check, fill-only approved amount/price fields, evidence capture, and stop before `Granska köp`.
- Mandatory aborts remain operator absent, browser/session not prepared, account/instrument mismatch, wrong side/order type, amount/price mismatch, total parse failure, cap exceeded, validation errors, modal/final confirm visible, review click targeted/requested, submit/order placement requested, credential/session handling requested, or any uncertainty.
- This remains documentation/decision-gate only: no live Avanza access, browser launch/control, DOM query, field fill, click, review modal, final confirm, submit/order placement, Supabase/DB call, provider/route/scan invocation, audit writer client invocation, trade/PnL mutation, migration, typegen, generated type edit, or `.env.local` change.

- Gate decision: `final_real_browser_run_harness_gate_ready`.
- Gate basis: `real_browser_run_approved_for_fill_only`, `real_browser_fill_only_run_gate_ready`, gated adapter exists, gated adapter simulation passed, `final_pre_run_evidence_ready`, GameStop/Valentin Labs KF/427,26 SEK/21,98 USD/438,05 SEK evidence under the 1,000 SEK cap, and all hard stops remain active.

# First Real Avanza Fill-Only POC Real Browser Adapter Skeleton

## Purpose

Action 1041 adds a disabled real browser adapter skeleton for the first fill-only POC. This is not the real browser adapter implementation, not a real run, and not an order path.

The skeleton is disabled by default and non-executing. It does not launch a browser, attach to a browser, access Avanza, query DOM, fill fields, click buttons, open review, submit, or place orders.

## Implementation

- Helper path: `lib/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-real-browser-adapter-skeleton.ts`
- Test path: `tests/e2e/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-real-browser-adapter-skeleton.spec.ts`
- Result statuses: `disabled`, `blocked`, `ready_for_real_browser_adapter_setup`, `failed_safety`
- Primary builder: `buildFirstFillOnlyPocRealBrowserAdapterSkeletonDecision(...)`
- Result status for this action: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_real_browser_adapter_skeleton_added`

The helper composes existing dry-run, manual setup, gated skeleton, implementation stub, approval, harness, fill-only guard, and selector mapping contracts as metadata-only readiness evidence.

## Disabled By Default

The default result is `disabled` unless `real_browser_adapter_enabled` is explicitly true. Enabling the flag only evaluates readiness and browser-boundary metadata. It does not grant browser access, DOM access, field fill, click, submit, broker, provider, route, audit writer, Supabase, or runtime permissions.

## Capability Flags

Browser capability flags are always false:

- `can_launch_browser`
- `can_attach_to_browser`
- `can_access_avanza`
- `can_query_dom`
- `can_read_session_storage`
- `can_read_cookies`

Execution capability flags are always false:

- `can_fill_fields`
- `can_click_review`
- `can_click_final_confirm`
- `can_submit_order`
- `can_place_order`

## Ready Status Meaning

`ready_for_real_browser_adapter_setup` means the metadata for a future disabled adapter design is ready. It does not launch a browser, access Avanza, query DOM, fill fields, approve clicking, open the review modal, submit, or place an order.

## Planned Browser-Check Metadata

The skeleton exposes metadata for a future separately approved action only:

- Browser manually opened by operator.
- Avanza manually logged in by operator.
- Operator verifies account.
- Operator verifies instrument.
- Verify buy side.
- Verify Limit/Avancerad.
- Prepare amount field metadata only.
- Prepare price field metadata only.
- Prepare total read metadata only.
- Stop before review.

## Blockers

The skeleton blocks on missing or unsafe prerequisites:

- Missing real browser safety gate readiness.
- Missing execution dry-run readiness.
- Missing manual setup readiness.
- Missing approval.
- Missing operator setup.
- Missing operator presence.
- Cap above 1,000 SEK.
- Wrong side or order type.
- Review requested.
- Final confirm requested.
- Credential/session handling requested.
- Forbidden browser, DOM, fill, click, submit, sell, Stop Loss, Glidande, account-change, side-switch, stepper, or select-all action requested.
- Missing evidence plan.
- Any safety failure inherited from the composed readiness contracts.

## Safety Confirmation

Action 1041 did not add runtime Avanza access, browser automation, DOM query code, field filling, clicking, submit behavior, Supabase/audit/provider/route/scan calls, or trade/PnL mutation.

Hard forbidden selectors include final confirmation selectors such as `button[data-e2e="confirmOrderButton"]` and buy/sell final confirm variants. Review selectors remain blocked by default, including buy and sell `orderButton` variants.

## Test Coverage

The new regression spec covers disabled defaults, all-false capability flags, readiness blockers, cap/side/order-type/review/final/credential-session safety failures, ready-state metadata, stop-before-review behavior, evidence requirements, forbidden selectors, blocked review selectors, naming safety, and static purity against browser automation, DOM, fetch, Supabase, provider, route, scan, and audit writer imports.

## Next Action

Recommended next action: Action 1042 - Add Real Browser Adapter Skeleton Simulation.

Reason: after the disabled skeleton exists, simulate the skeleton readiness locally before any future real browser implementation is considered.
