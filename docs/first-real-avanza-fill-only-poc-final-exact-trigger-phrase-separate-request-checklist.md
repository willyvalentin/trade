# First Real Avanza Fill-Only POC Final Exact Trigger Phrase Separate-Request Checklist

## Purpose

This document adds the final exact trigger phrase separate-request checklist.

This is not a live run. It does not access Avanza, launch or control a browser, query DOM, fill fields, click anything, open a review modal, submit or place an order, handle credentials/session data, mutate trades/stats/PnL, invoke or execute the exact trigger phrase, or call the trigger/action/wrapper/runner.

This documents that the exact trigger phrase itself must now be explicitly provided again in a separate future request before invocation can be considered.

Ready never means execution occurred.

## Final Exact Trigger Phrase Separate-Request Checklist

| Historical exact trigger phrase invoked | BLOCK | Must not be invoked by this action |
| Exact trigger phrase explicitly re-provided for invocation | BLOCK | Must be separate future request, not Action 1118 |
| Trigger/action/wrapper/runner invoked by this action | BLOCK | Must not be invoked in this checklist action |
| Approved account locked | PASS | Valentin Labs KF |
| Approved instrument locked | PASS | GameStop |
| Approved side locked | PASS | Buy-only |
| Approved order mode locked | PASS | Avancerad/Limit |
| Approved amount locked | PASS | 427,26 SEK |
| Approved price locked | PASS | 21,98 USD |
| Approved cap locked | PASS | <= 1,000 SEK |
| Last captured total below cap | PASS | 438,05 SEK from prior evidence |
| Approved runner boundary locked | PASS | `verifyVisibleOrderFormState`, `fillAmountField`, `fillPriceField`, `readTotalAmount`, `captureEvidence`, `stopBeforeReview` |
| Hard stop before review locked | PASS | Stop before Granska köp |
| Fresh exact trigger phrase separate-request confirmation not captured in this action | WARN / EXPECTED | Next action should capture exact confirmation/template if needed |
| No live execute attempt performed yet | WARN / EXPECTED | This action is checklist-only |
| Live execute evidence package not captured yet | WARN / EXPECTED | Belongs to a future explicit attempt |
| No order placement evidence | PASS | No order has been placed |

This checklist does not mark a live execution as performed, does not mark live evidence as captured, does not mark the exact trigger phrase as invoked, and does not mark the trigger/action/wrapper/runner as invoked.

## Operator Checklist Text For Future Confirmation

The following exact operator checklist template may be copied into the next action:

```text
FINAL EXACT TRIGGER PHRASE SEPARATE-REQUEST CONFIRMATION: I confirm right now that I am present, Avanza is open and logged in manually, BankID/2FA has already been handled manually by me, account Valentin Labs KF and instrument GameStop are still manually verified, the order form is still buy-side Avancerad/Limit, amount is still 427,26 SEK, price is still 21,98 USD, total is still 438,05 SEK or otherwise under the 1,000 SEK cap, no modal is open, no Bekräfta köp/sälj is visible, Granska köp has not been clicked, the exact trigger phrase has been historically captured but has not been invoked or executed, the trigger/action/wrapper/runner have not been invoked, I understand that the exact trigger phrase itself must be explicitly provided again in a separate future request before any invocation can be considered, and any future exact trigger phrase invocation must still use the approved explicit invocation trigger, action, and wrapper boundary to verify visible state, fill the approved amount and price fields, read total, capture evidence, and stop before Granska köp, it must not click Granska köp, must not open review modal, must not click Bekräfta köp/sälj, must not submit/place an order, must not handle credentials/session data, must not run unattended, must not be wired to automatic UI/routes/provider/scanner/package scripts, and must abort on any mismatch or uncertainty.
```

Action 1118 only creates the checklist/template. It does not claim that this exact fresh confirmation has already been provided, does not invoke the exact trigger phrase, does not invoke the trigger/action/wrapper/runner, and does not recommend a live attempt yet.

## Captured Exact Trigger Phrase Reminder

Historical reminder only:

```text
FINAL LIVE EXECUTE ATTEMPT EXPLICIT INVOCATION TRIGGER: I explicitly request the final live fill-only execute attempt trigger now, with the approved boundary, stopping before Granska köp and without order placement.
```

The exact trigger phrase has been historically captured but is not invoked or executed by this action. The exact trigger phrase itself must now be explicitly provided again in a separate future request before invocation can be considered. The trigger phrase does not authorize review click, final confirm, submit, or order placement. The trigger phrase must not be treated as live execution.

## Checklist Decision

`final_exact_trigger_phrase_separate_request_checklist_ready`

This means the final exact trigger phrase separate-request checklist is ready for a future exact operator confirmation. It does not mean execution has occurred.

Do not use `final_exact_trigger_phrase_separate_request_confirmation_ready` in this action.

## Result Status

`first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_exact_trigger_phrase_separate_request_checklist_added`

## Recommended Next Action

`Action 1119 — Capture Final Exact Trigger Phrase Separate-Request Confirmation`

After the final exact trigger phrase separate-request checklist is ready, the next step is to capture the exact fresh operator separate-request confirmation before the exact trigger phrase itself can be provided again in a separate future request or any explicit final live execute attempt trigger can be considered.

Action 1119 must still be documentation/confirmation capture only unless separately approved. Do not recommend a live attempt yet. Do not run the trigger yet.

## Progress Update

- Ture production/data-health: 95-97%
- Market-window live dry-run: 92-95%
- Semi-auto agent foundation: 98-99%
- Semi-auto Avanza/browser-agent readiness: 99-100%
- Real browser automation readiness: 100%
- First Avanza fill-only POC readiness: 100%
- Full-auto readiness: 10-15%, deferred
- Total Ture toward semi-auto MVP: 99-100%

Full-auto remains explicitly deferred.
