## Action 717 - Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Validator Reassessment

- Created docs/execution-record-audit-append-writer-dry-run-execution-validator-reassessment.md as a documentation-only reassessment of the Action 716 validator.
- Reconfirmed validateExecutionRecordAuditAppendWriterDryRunExecution remains pure, deterministic, conservative, diagnostics/readiness-only, and disconnected from dry-run execution, audit writer execution, audit append execution, route calls, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage writes, audit writes, downstream actions, broker/Avanza behavior, and automatic mode.
- Reconfirmed ready means only audit_append_writer_dry_run_execution_validation_ready_for_design_only with decision design_only_do_not_write_audit; it is not dry-run execution, audit write approval, audit append execution, route approval, persistence/write approval, security proof, server-only proof, schema proof, generated-types proof, migration proof, RLS/security proof, downstream approval, or full workflow completion.
- Reconfirmed all dry-run execution, writer, audit append, route, record creation, persistence, Supabase/localStorage, stats/PnL, trade, rollback, UI, notification, broker/Avanza, and automatic-mode authority flags remain false.
- Validation: git diff --check passed; find docs -type f -size 0 returned no files.
- Recommended next action: Action 718 - Integrate Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Validator into Dev Preview.

## Action 716 - Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Validator

- Created lib/execution-record-audit-append-writer-dry-run-execution-validator.ts as a pure deterministic validator for audit append writer dry-run execution readiness.
- Validator output remains design/readiness-only: a ready result may only recommend design_only_do_not_write_audit.
- The validator does not execute dry-run logic, write audit data, execute writer logic, call routes, create records, persist/write, update stats/PnL, mutate/reconcile trades, roll back/correct, update UI, notify users, run broker/order behavior, run Avanza/browser behavior, or enable automatic mode.
- Dry-run execution validation success is not dry-run execution, audit write approval, security proof, server-only proof, schema proof, generated-types proof, migration proof, RLS/security proof, or downstream approval; all action authority flags remain false.
- Validation: ./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit passed; npm run lint passed; git diff --check passed; find docs -type f -size 0 returned no files; npm run test:e2e was initially sandbox-blocked before app logic by listen EPERM on 0.0.0.0:3010, then passed with escalation (137 passed).
- Recommended next action: Action 717 - Reassess Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Validator.

## 1. Purpose

Action 699 reassesses the dev-preview wiring added in Action 698 for
`validateExecutionRecordAuditAppendWriterContract(...)`.

The purpose is to verify that audit append writer contract-validator diagnostics
are displayed safely in the persistence validator integration preview while the
preview remains dev-gated, fixture-first, explicit-trigger, read-only, visually
separate, and disconnected from audit writer execution, audit append execution,
route calls, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior,
Supabase/localStorage writes, downstream actions, broker/Avanza behavior, and
automatic mode.

This reassessment is documentation-only. It adds no runtime code, refactor,
behavior change, audit writer, audit append implementation, audit route,
production route call, insert route call, execution-record creation,
persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, stats/PnL
update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI update/action
beyond existing diagnostics display, notification execution, broker/order
behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, Supabase type generation, or
migration application.

## 2. Current Wiring Inventory

Fixture file:

- `lib/execution-record-persistence-validator-integration-dev-fixture.ts`
- Imports `validateExecutionRecordAuditAppendWriterContract(...)`.
- Builds `auditAppendWriterContractValidationInput` from controlled fixture
  data and existing writer validator diagnostics.
- Stores `auditAppendWriterContractValidationResult` on each fixture scenario.
- Marks metadata as fixture-only and diagnostics-only with
  `callsAuditAppendWriterContractValidator`,
  `auditAppendWriterContractValidatorRan`, and
  `auditAppendWriterContractValidatorDiagnosticsOnly`.

Preview component:

- `components/execution/ExecutionRecordPersistenceValidatorIntegrationPreview.tsx`
- Renders a visually separate `Audit Append Writer Contract Validator` section.
- Renders separate summary and authority-flag sections for contract validation.
- Renders blocked reasons, warnings, and review items from the contract
  validator result.

Hook state/message:

- `hooks/execution/useLatePhasePreviewState.ts`
- The persistence validator integration preview remains hidden unless execution
  dev tools are enabled.
- The run path builds controlled fixture data only and continues to describe no
  production route implementation, production route call, production insert,
  record creation, persistence, audit append, audit write, stats, rollback,
  correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI source-of-truth update,
  notification, browser, Avanza, broker, or order behavior.

Test coverage:

- `tests/e2e/execution-sandbox.spec.ts`
- Covers direct contract-validator design-only behavior.
- Covers unsafe contract-validator inputs.
- Covers fixture scenario contract-validator result fields.
- Covers the visible preview section, safety labels, summaries, authority
  flags, and diagnostic lists.

Docs/checkpoint/QA references:

- Action 698 breadcrumbs were added to the requested docs, checkpoint, and QA
  notes.
- Action 699 adds this reassessment and records the Action 698 repair
  verification.

## 3. Action 698 Repair Verification

Action 698 had a bulk documentation breadcrumb insertion failure. The failed
operation emptied the requested documentation targets mid-run.

Repair state verified in Action 699:

- the docs were repaired immediately during Action 698
- tracked docs were restored from `HEAD` and received the Action 698 breadcrumb
- untracked requested docs were restored with Action 698 breadcrumb and repair
  notes
- `find docs -type f -size 0` returned no zero-byte documentation files during
  Action 699 inspection
- tracked docs restored from `HEAD` are not empty
- untracked docs restored with Action 698 breadcrumb/repair notes are not empty
- `docs/execution-agent-checkpoint.md` and `docs/execution-agent-qa-notes.md`
  include the Action 698 breadcrumb
- no additional destructive documentation rewrite was performed for this
  reassessment

Risk carried forward:

- future doc breadcrumb updates should avoid truncating writes and should verify
  non-empty files after any mechanical update

## 4. Contract Validator Usage Verification

Verified:

- the fixture calls `validateExecutionRecordAuditAppendWriterContract(...)`
- the fixture uses controlled fixture-only data
- the fixture passes the audit append writer contract input/result and audit
  append writer validator result into the contract validator
- ready scenarios return
  `audit_append_writer_contract_validation_ready_for_design_only`
- ready scenarios recommend `design_only_do_not_write_audit`
- blocked/review paths remain represented through direct e2e contract-validator
  tests and fixture review scenario assertions
- the preview displays the contract validation result
- the preview displays the decision `design_only_do_not_write_audit`

## 5. Preview Content Verification

The preview displays:

- status
- decision
- input shape validation summary
- result shape validation summary
- server-only/security dependency summary
- schema/type dependency summary
- idempotency/duplicate-prevention summary
- evidence/provenance summary
- no-write/no-action safety summary
- dependency validation summary
- authority flags
- blocked reasons
- warnings
- review items

The summary section includes writer contract input, writer contract result,
writer validator result, execution-record reference, audit event candidate,
evidence provenance, idempotency key, duplicate prevention key, server-only
proof, service-role proof, audit schema/table proof, generated audit types,
migration proof, RLS/security proof, no-write/no-action safety, and audit write
path presence.

## 6. Safety Label Verification

The preview contains visible wording or equivalent labels for:

- Dev preview only
- Contract validator diagnostics only
- Design/readiness only
- Design-only do not write audit
- Contract validation is not audit write approval
- Contract validation is not security proof
- Contract validation is not server-only proof
- Contract validation is not schema/table proof
- Contract validation is not generated-types proof
- Contract validation is not migration proof
- Contract validation is not RLS/security proof
- Checklist status is not proof
- Dev-preview diagnostics are not proof/write approval
- Writer validator readiness is not write approval
- Writer contract readiness is not write approval
- Insert success is not audit write approval
- Contract validation success is not downstream approval
- No audit write
- No audit append
- No route call
- No record creation
- No persistence/write
- No Supabase/localStorage write
- No stats/PnL update
- No trade mutation/reconciliation
- No rollback/correction
- No UI update
- No notification execution
- No broker/order action
- No Avanza/browser action
- Automatic mode disabled

## 7. Authority Flag Verification

The preview displays the following authority flags as false:

- `contractValidatorImplemented=false`
- `writerValidatorImplemented=false`
- `writerImplemented=false`
- `auditAppendImplemented=false`
- `auditRouteImplemented=false`
- `auditWriteAllowed=false`
- `safeToWriteAudit=false`
- `auditAppendAllowed=false`
- `safeToAppendAudit=false`
- `routeCallAllowed=false`
- `recordCreationAllowed=false`
- `persistenceWriteAllowed=false`
- `supabaseWriteAllowed=false`
- `localStorageWriteAllowed=false`
- `statsPnlUpdateAllowed=false`
- `tradeMutationAllowed=false`
- `tradeReconciliationAllowed=false`
- `correctionRollbackAllowed=false`
- `uiStateMutationAllowed=false`
- `userNotificationAllowed=false`
- `brokerOrderFollowUpAllowed=false`
- `avanzaBrowserFollowUpAllowed=false`
- `automaticModeAllowed=false`

## 8. Boundary Verification

Verified boundary state:

- dev-gated only
- fixture-first
- explicit-trigger
- read-only
- visually separate
- no audit writer execution
- no audit append execution
- no audit route
- no route calls
- no production route implementation/call
- no insert route call
- no execution-record creation
- no persistence/write
- no Supabase/localStorage write
- no audit write
- no stats/PnL update
- no rollback/correction
- no trade mutation/reconciliation
- no notification execution
- no browser/Avanza behavior
- no broker/order behavior
- no automatic mode

The preview does not create audit write buttons, does not introduce
`KOP`/`SALJ` action controls, and does not introduce broker/Avanza execution
controls. Existing UI behavior is limited to displaying diagnostics from
controlled fixture output.

## 9. Test Result Assessment

Action 698 validation remains the test evidence for this reassessment:

- `./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit` passed
- `npm run lint` passed with the existing Babel large-file note for
  `app/trade-app.tsx`
- `git diff --check` passed
- sandbox e2e hit known `listen EPERM` on `0.0.0.0:3010`
- focused selector `npm run test:e2e -- -g "contract validator"` found no
  matching test title after escalation
- matching targeted run
  `npm run test:e2e -- -g "audit append writer contract"` passed 2/2
- escalated full `npm run test:e2e` passed 133/133

Action 699 validation:

- `git diff --check` is required for this documentation-only reassessment

## 10. Relationship Verification

Relationship to audit append writer contract validator:

- the dev preview consumes the pure contract-validator result for diagnostics
  only
- contract validation success is not audit write approval

Relationship to audit append writer validator:

- the contract validator depends on writer validator diagnostics as input
- writer validator readiness is not write approval

Relationship to audit append writer contract:

- the contract validator checks the proposed writer contract input/result shape
- it does not execute a writer

Relationship to server-only/security checklist:

- checklist status is displayed as a dependency, not proof
- server-only proof and service-role proof remain required before any future
  writer execution design

Relationship to dev-preview diagnostics chain:

- the preview remains one fixture-driven diagnostics chain
- each layer remains visually separated and no layer grants downstream action
  authority

Relationship to generated types/migration proof:

- generated audit table types, migration proof, audit schema/table proof, and
  RLS/security proof remain dependencies and gaps
- generated execution-record types alone are not enough for audit writer
  readiness

Relationship to post-insert/production insert boundary diagnostics:

- insert-route dry-run success, post-insert readiness, production boundary
  readiness, and audit append boundary readiness remain separate diagnostics
- none authorizes audit writes or downstream actions

## 11. Remaining Gaps

Remaining gaps:

- no audit writer implementation
- no audit route/write path
- no audit schema/table proof
- no generated audit table types
- no production insert route
- no production insert/write path
- no migration proof
- no generated types proof
- no RLS/security proof
- no server-only proof
- no audit/stats/trade mutation execution
- no broker/Avanza execution

## 12. Candidate Next Actions

A. Create Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Result Design

- defines a future no-write dry-run output shape before any writer can exist
- keeps audit append behavior separate from execution-record insert diagnostics

B. Create Production Insert Route Implementation Design

- defines future production insert route constraints
- still must not imply audit writer execution

C. Create Audit Append Writer Proof Artifact Checklist

- defines the evidence required to prove server-only/security/schema/type
  readiness before implementation

D. Create Persistence Insert Dry-Run Reassessment

- reassesses the insert dry-run route after the post-insert/audit diagnostics
  chain grew larger

## 13. Recommended Next Action

Recommended next action:

- Action 700 - Create Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Result Design

Reason:

- the audit append writer contract validator now has visible diagnostics, but
  the next safe artifact should still be no-write and design-only
- a dry-run result design can clarify what a future writer would report without
  introducing writer execution, audit append execution, route calls, or
  persistence/write behavior

## 14. Risk Assessment

Risks to keep guarded:

- preview mistaken for audit write readiness
- diagnostics mistaken for audit write approval
- contract validator readiness mistaken for proof
- checklist mistaken for proof
- dev preview mistaken for proof
- service role exposed
- client-side audit write accidentally possible
- duplicate audit writes
- missing idempotency
- missing evidence/provenance
- audit schema/table assumed without proof
- generated execution-record types assumed enough
- contract validation success mistaken for downstream approval
- broker/Avanza accidentally triggered
- automatic mode accidentally enabled
- docs accidentally zeroed by bulk operations

Mitigations already visible:

- explicit no-proof/no-write labels
- all action authority flags remain false
- fixture-only preview data
- no audit write buttons
- no broker/Avanza controls
- Action 698 repair note and Action 699 zero-byte verification

## 15. Verification

Action 699 verification:

- inspected `lib/execution-record-persistence-validator-integration-dev-fixture.ts`
- inspected `components/execution/ExecutionRecordPersistenceValidatorIntegrationPreview.tsx`
- inspected `hooks/execution/useLatePhasePreviewState.ts`
- inspected `tests/e2e/execution-sandbox.spec.ts`
- inspected `lib/execution-record-audit-append-writer-contract-validator.ts`
- inspected
  `lib/execution-record-audit-append-writer-contract-validator-contract.ts`
- inspected `lib/execution-record-audit-append-writer-validator.ts`
- inspected `lib/execution-record-audit-append-writer-validator-contract.ts`
- inspected docs/checkpoint/QA Action 698 repair references
- verified no zero-byte files under `docs`
- validation command: `git diff --check`

No runtime behavior was added or changed by Action 699.

## Action 718 - Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Validator Dev Preview Wiring

- Integrated the audit append writer dry-run execution validator into the dev-gated persistence integration preview using fixture-only data from the existing dry-run validator, writer validator, contract validator, audit event candidate, execution-record reference, evidence/provenance, idempotency, duplicate-prevention, proof-status, and authority metadata.
- The preview now renders the validator status, decision, input/result validation summaries, simulated audit event/table/idempotency/evidence/server-only/no-write/dependency summaries, authority flags, blocked reasons, warnings, and review items.
- Output remains diagnostics/readiness-only; a ready result may only mean design_only_do_not_write_audit and is not dry-run execution, audit writer execution, audit append execution, route approval, record creation, persistence/write approval, Supabase/localStorage write approval, security/server-only/schema/generated-types/migration/RLS proof, downstream approval, or workflow completion.
- No dry-run execution, audit write, audit append, route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write, Supabase/localStorage write, stats/PnL update, trade mutation/reconciliation, rollback/correction, UI update beyond fixture diagnostics, notification, broker/order action, Avanza/browser action, automatic mode, type generation, migration application, or audit schema/table assumption was added.
- All dry-run execution, audit/write/route/creation/persistence/Supabase/localStorage/stats/trade/rollback/UI/notification/broker/Avanza/automatic authority flags remain false; the dev preview remains explicit-trigger, read-only, visually separate, and fixture-first.
- Validation target: tsc, lint, git diff --check, zero-byte docs check, full e2e, and focused dry-run execution e2e coverage.
- Recommended next action: Action 719 - Reassess Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Validator Dev Preview Wiring.

## Action 719 - Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Validator Dev Preview Wiring Reassessment

- Created the documentation-only reassessment for the audit append writer dry-run execution validator dev-preview wiring.
- Verified the fixture calls validateExecutionRecordAuditAppendWriterDryRunExecution(...) with controlled fixture-only data and stores the result for ready/review scenarios.
- Verified the dev preview displays the Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Validator section, status, decision, validation summaries, authority flags, blocked reasons, warnings, and review items.
- Confirmed the preview remains dev-gated, fixture-first, explicit-trigger, read-only, visually separate, diagnostics-only, and disconnected from dry-run execution, audit writer execution, audit append execution, route calls, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage writes, downstream actions, broker/Avanza behavior, and automatic mode.
- Confirmed no runtime code changes, refactor, behavior changes, dry-run execution, audit writer, route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write, Supabase/localStorage write, or audit append implementation were added.
- Recommended next action: Action 720 - Create Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Implementation Design.

## Action 720 - Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Implementation Design

- Created the documentation-only implementation design for a future audit append writer dry-run execution function.
- Defined the non-persistent simulation principle, future inputs, outputs, deterministic algorithm, blocked/invalid states, all-false authority model, validator relationship, audit writer relationship, production route relationship, dev preview relationship, future test strategy, risks, and next action.
- Confirmed this action does not implement dry-run execution, audit writer execution, audit append, route calls, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage writes, audit writes, stats/PnL updates, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI updates, notifications, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, type generation, migration application, or audit schema/table assumptions.
- Documented that future dry-run execution success must not be interpreted as audit write approval, proof, route approval, persistence approval, downstream approval, or workflow completion.
- Recommended next action: Action 721 - Create Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Implementation Contract Types.

## Action 721 - Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Implementation Contract Types

Action 721 added lib/execution-record-audit-append-writer-dry-run-execution-implementation-contract.ts as type-only/constants-only contract metadata for a future audit append writer dry-run execution implementation. The contract describes implementation input/result/status/decision/safety policy/authority flags/blocked reasons/warnings/review items and simulated audit payload, table-schema target, idempotency, duplicate-prevention, evidence provenance, server-only security, no-write/no-action, and dependency summaries.

No dry-run execution implementation, audit writer logic, route calls, execution-record creation, audit append, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, stats/PnL update, trade mutation/reconciliation, rollback/correction, UI update, notification, broker/Avanza behavior, automatic mode, Supabase type generation, migration application, or schema/table assumption was added. Contract result success remains non-authoritative: it is not audit write approval, security proof, server-only proof, schema proof, generated-types proof, migration proof, RLS/security proof, or downstream approval.

All action authority flags remain false. No zero-byte docs should remain after validation. Recommended next action: Action 722 - Reassess Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Implementation Contract Types.

## Action 722 - Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Implementation Contract Types Reassessment

Action 722 added docs/execution-record-audit-append-writer-dry-run-execution-implementation-contract-reassessment.md as a documentation-only reassessment of the Action 721 contract types. It verifies the contract remains type-only/constants-only, contract-only, dry-run-execution-implementation-contract-only, future-boundary-only, and disconnected from runtime dry-run execution, writer logic, route calls, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage writes, audit append execution, downstream actions, broker/Avanza behavior, and automatic mode.

The reassessment confirms contract result success is not audit write approval, audit append execution, route approval, record creation approval, persistence/write approval, Supabase/localStorage write approval, security proof, server-only proof, schema/table proof, generated-types proof, migration proof, RLS/security proof, downstream approval, or full workflow completion. All action authority flags remain false.

Remaining blockers are unchanged: audit schema/table proof, generated audit table types, migration proof, RLS/security proof, server-only/service-role/route-auth proof, writer implementation, dry-run execution implementation, production insert route, and production insert/write path remain absent or unproven. Recommended next action: Action 723 - Create Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Implementation.

## Action 723 - Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Implementation

Action 723 added lib/execution-record-audit-append-writer-dry-run-execution-implementation.ts with executeAuditAppendWriterDryRun as a pure deterministic dry-run simulation only. The implementation inspects validated contract inputs and returns a non-persistent would-write diagnostic result with simulated audit event payload, table/schema target, idempotency, duplicate-prevention, evidence/provenance, server-only/security dependency, no-write/no-action, and dependency summaries.

No audit writer execution, audit append, audit route, production route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI update, notification execution, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, Supabase type generation, migration application, or audit schema/table assumption was added. Ready-for-design-only remains design_only_do_not_write_audit and is not audit write approval, route approval, persistence/write approval, security proof, server-only proof, schema/table proof, generated-types proof, migration proof, RLS/security proof, downstream approval, or full workflow completion.

Focused e2e coverage was added for ready simulation output, deterministic summaries, all-false authority flags, missing prerequisite blockers, unsafe authority invalidation, and no write/route/Supabase/localStorage side effects. Remaining blockers are unchanged for real audit writes: audit schema/table proof, generated audit table types, migration proof, RLS/security proof, server-only/service-role/route-auth proof, audit writer implementation, production insert route, and production insert/write path remain absent or unproven.


## Action 724 - Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Implementation Reassessment

Action 724 added docs/execution-record-audit-append-writer-dry-run-execution-implementation-reassessment.md as a documentation-only reassessment of executeAuditAppendWriterDryRun(...). The reassessment verifies the implementation remains pure, deterministic, non-persistent, diagnostics/readiness-only, and disconnected from audit writer execution, audit append execution, route calls, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage writes, downstream actions, broker/Avanza behavior, and automatic mode.

It confirms ready-for-design-only is design_only_do_not_write_audit and is not a real write, audit write approval, audit append execution, route approval, record creation approval, persistence/write approval, Supabase/localStorage write approval, security proof, server-only proof, schema/table proof, generated-types proof, migration proof, RLS/security proof, downstream action approval, or full workflow completion. All action authority flags remain false, and remaining blockers for real audit writes are unchanged.

Action 723 validation evidence remains: tsc passed, lint passed, git diff check passed, zero-byte docs check passed, sandbox e2e hit the known EPERM 0.0.0.0:3010 blocker before app logic, and escalated full e2e passed 139/139. Recommended next action: Action 725 - Integrate Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Diagnostics into Dev Preview.


## Action 725 - Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Diagnostics Dev Preview Integration

Action 725 integrated audit append writer dry-run execution diagnostics into the existing dev-gated persistence validator integration preview. The fixture now shapes fixture-only dry-run execution implementation input from existing validator, contract, dry-run, audit event, execution-record reference, evidence/provenance, idempotency, duplicate-prevention, proof-status, risk-status, manual-review, and downstream-authority artifacts, then calls executeAuditAppendWriterDryRun(...) for display-only diagnostics.

The preview now displays a visually separate Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution section with status, decision recommendation, deterministic simulated audit event payload, table/schema target, idempotency, duplicate-prevention, evidence/provenance, server-only/security dependency, no-write/no-action safety, dependency summary, authority flags, blocked reasons, warnings, and review items. The preview explicitly states the dry-run execution result remains non-persistent would-write diagnostics only and is not real write, audit write approval, audit append execution, route approval, record creation approval, persistence/write approval, Supabase/localStorage write approval, security proof, server-only proof, schema proof, generated-types proof, migration proof, RLS/security proof, downstream approval, or workflow completion.

All action authority flags remain false. No real dry-run against production data, audit writer execution, audit append execution, route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, source-of-truth UI update, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, Supabase type generation, migration application, or audit schema/table assumption was added. Recommended next action: Action 726 - Reassess Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Diagnostics Dev Preview Wiring.


### Action 725 Validation Results

Validation for Action 725: ./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit passed; npm run lint passed; git diff --check passed; find docs -type f -size 0 passed with no output. Sandboxed npm run test:e2e and sandboxed npm run test:e2e -- -g "dry-run execution" both failed before app test logic with the known EPERM 0.0.0.0:3010 web-server bind blocker. Escalated npm run test:e2e passed 139/139, and escalated npm run test:e2e -- -g "dry-run execution" passed 5/5.


## Action 726 - Audit Append Writer Dry-Run Execution Diagnostics Dev Preview Wiring Reassessment

Action 726 added docs/execution-record-audit-append-writer-dry-run-execution-diagnostics-dev-preview-wiring-reassessment.md as a documentation-only reassessment of the Action 725 dev-preview wiring. The reassessment verifies that the persistence validator integration dev preview displays executeAuditAppendWriterDryRun(...) output from fixture-only data, remains dev-gated, explicit-trigger, read-only, visually separate, and non-persistent diagnostics-only.

It confirms the preview displays dry-run execution implementation status, design_only_do_not_write_audit decision, deterministic simulated audit event payload, table/schema target, idempotency, duplicate-prevention, evidence/provenance, server-only/security dependency, no-write/no-action safety, dependency summary, authority flags, blocked reasons, warnings, and review items. It also confirms visible safety labels state the dry-run execution result is not real write, audit write approval, audit append execution, route approval, record creation approval, persistence/write approval, Supabase/localStorage write approval, security proof, server-only proof, schema proof, generated-types proof, migration proof, RLS/security proof, downstream approval, or workflow completion.

No runtime behavior was changed for Action 726. No real dry-run execution against real data, audit writer execution, audit append, route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, type generation, migration application, or audit schema/table assumption was added. Recommended next action: Action 727 - Create Audit Writer Proof Artifact Checklist.


## Action 727 - Audit Writer Proof Artifact Checklist

Action 727 added docs/execution-record-audit-writer-proof-artifact-checklist.md as a documentation-only checklist for proof artifacts required before any real audit writer, audit route, audit append, production insert route link, or write path can be implemented. The checklist inventories required evidence for audit schema/table proof, migration proof, generated audit table types, remote environment verification, RLS/security, service-role/server-only boundaries, client-bundle scans, route/auth boundaries, idempotency and duplicate prevention, evidence/provenance, logging/error safety, downstream no-authority, no broker/Avanza/automatic behavior, rollback/unknown-status handling, manual review, dry-run chain limits, and production insert route separation.

The checklist is not proof by itself. It explicitly states that dry-run/dev-preview diagnostics are not proof, are not write approval, and cannot replace schema, security, route, idempotency, or remote environment evidence.

No runtime behavior was changed for Action 727. No audit writer, audit route, route call, production route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, audit append execution, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI update beyond existing diagnostics display, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, Supabase type generation, migration application, or audit schema/table assumption was added. Recommended next action: Action 728 - Reassess Audit Writer Proof Artifact Checklist.


## Action 728 - Audit Writer Proof Artifact Checklist Reassessment

Action 728 added docs/execution-record-audit-writer-proof-artifact-checklist-reassessment.md as a documentation-only reassessment of the Action 727 proof artifact checklist. The reassessment verifies that the checklist remains documentation-only, is not proof by itself, and only inventories proof requirements for audit schema/table design, migration, generated audit table types, remote environment, RLS/security, service-role/server-only boundaries, client-bundle scans, route/auth boundaries, idempotency and duplicate prevention, evidence/provenance, logging/error safety, downstream no-authority, no broker/Avanza/automatic behavior, rollback/unknown-status handling, manual review, dry-run chain limits, production insert route separation, blocker registry, and reviewer/date/blocker evidence fields.

The reassessment confirms the checklist does not create schema proof, migration proof, generated types proof, RLS proof, server-only proof, service-role proof, route/auth proof, idempotency proof, duplicate-prevention proof, evidence/provenance proof, downstream no-authority proof, or dry-run/dev-preview proof. Dry-run diagnostics and dev-preview visibility remain not proof and not write approval.

No runtime behavior was changed for Action 728. No audit writer, audit route, route call, production route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, audit append execution, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI update beyond existing diagnostics display, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, Supabase type generation, migration application, or audit schema/table assumption was added. Recommended next action: Action 729 - Create Audit Schema/Table Design.


## Action 729 - Audit Schema/Table Design

Action 729 added docs/execution-record-audit-schema-table-design.md as a documentation-only design for a future audit writer table. The design proposes public.execution_record_audit_events as a future append-only audit event table and documents proposed table identity, columns, constraints/indexes, idempotency and duplicate-prevention model, evidence/provenance model, RLS/security considerations, generated type requirements, migration requirements, relationships to the audit writer, production insert route, and dry-run diagnostics, open questions, remaining proof artifacts, risks, and next action.

The design is not schema proof, does not prove the table exists remotely, does not create or apply a migration, does not generate Supabase types, and does not approve any audit writer, route, route call, write path, audit append, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, downstream action, broker/Avanza behavior, or automatic mode. Dry-run/dev-preview diagnostics may reference the design only as a hypothetical target and remain not proof or write approval.

No runtime behavior was changed for Action 729. No migration file, migration application, generated types, audit writer, audit route, production route, route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, audit append execution, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI update beyond existing diagnostics display, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, or remote schema assumption was added. Recommended next action: Action 730 - Reassess Audit Schema/Table Design.


## Action 730 - Audit Schema/Table Design Reassessment

Action 730 added docs/execution-record-audit-schema-table-design-reassessment.md as a documentation-only reassessment of the Action 729 audit schema/table design. The reassessment verifies that docs/execution-record-audit-schema-table-design.md remains a non-proof design artifact for proposed public.execution_record_audit_events and covers table identity, the full column matrix, constraints/indexes, idempotency and duplicate-prevention, evidence/provenance, RLS/security considerations, generated type requirements, migration requirements, relationships to the audit writer, production insert route, and dry-run diagnostics, open questions, remaining proof gaps, and risks.

The reassessment confirms the design is not schema proof, not remote table proof, does not create or apply a migration, does not generate types, does not implement writer/route/write behavior, and does not close migration, generated-type, RLS/security, server-only/service-role, route/auth, idempotency, duplicate-prevention, or evidence/provenance proof gaps.

No runtime behavior was changed for Action 730. No migration file, migration application, generated types, audit writer, audit route, production route, route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, audit append execution, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI update beyond existing diagnostics display, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, or remote schema assumption was added. Recommended next action: Action 731 - Create Audit Table Migration Design.


## Action 731 - Audit Table Migration Design

Action 731 added docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-design.md as a documentation-only migration design for future public.execution_record_audit_events. The design translates the Action 729 schema/table design into proposed migration identity, intended operations, a clearly marked draft/non-applied SQL skeleton, idempotency and duplicate-prevention migration details, evidence/provenance fields, RLS/security considerations, generated type requirements, remote verification requirements, rollback/backout considerations, relationships to the audit writer, dry-run diagnostics, and production insert route, open questions, remaining proof artifacts, risks, and next action.

The migration design is not a migration file, is not migration proof, is not schema proof, does not prove the table exists remotely, does not apply anything, and does not generate Supabase types. Dry-run/dev-preview diagnostics may reference the proposed migration target only as hypothetical and remain not migration proof or write approval.

No runtime behavior was changed for Action 731. No migration file, migration application, generated types, audit writer, audit route, production route, route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, audit append execution, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI update beyond existing diagnostics display, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, or remote schema assumption was added. Recommended next action: Action 732 - Reassess Audit Table Migration Design.


## Action 732 - Audit Table Migration Design Reassessment

Action 732 added docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-design-reassessment.md as a documentation-only reassessment of the Action 731 audit table migration design. The reassessment verifies that docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-design.md remains a non-proof migration-design artifact for future public.execution_record_audit_events and covers proposed migration identity, path pattern, target schema/table, dependency on execution_records, intended SQL operations, draft SQL skeleton, idempotency and duplicate-prevention design, evidence/provenance design, RLS/security considerations, generated type requirements, remote verification requirements, rollback/backout considerations, relationships to the audit writer, dry-run diagnostics, and production insert route, open questions, proof gaps, and risks.

The reassessment confirms the migration design is not a migration file, not migration proof, not schema proof, not remote table proof, does not create or apply a migration, does not generate types, does not implement writer/route/write behavior, and does not close migration, generated-type, RLS/security, server-only/service-role, route/auth, idempotency, duplicate-prevention, or evidence/provenance proof gaps.

No runtime behavior was changed for Action 732. No migration file, migration application, generated types, audit writer, audit route, production route, route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit write, audit append execution, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, UI update beyond existing diagnostics display, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, or remote schema assumption was added. Recommended next action: Action 733 - Create Audit Table Migration File.


## Action 733 - Audit Table Migration File

Action 733 added supabase/migrations/20260615000000_create_execution_record_audit_events.sql as the local Supabase migration file for future public.execution_record_audit_events. The migration creates the audit event table with execution_record_id, event type/source/status fields, JSONB event/evidence/metadata payloads, actor/source/request/trace fields, idempotency and duplicate-prevention fields, timestamps, schema/writer version fields, non-empty checks for required text values, event_status allowlist, idempotency uniqueness, partial duplicate-prevention uniqueness, execution_record_id/event_type/event_status/created_at/source_fingerprint indexes, FK reference to public.execution_records(id), and safety comments.

The migration file is local only and was not applied. Remote table proof remains absent, generated audit table types were not generated, RLS/security/server-only/service-role proof remains missing, and no audit writer, audit route, production route, route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write behavior, audit append implementation, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, or remote schema assumption was added. The migration intentionally creates no permissive client write policy and leaves RLS/policy proof as a blocker before writer/route implementation.

Validation requested for Action 733 includes tsc, lint, git diff check, zero-byte docs check, and e2e. Recommended next action: Action 734 - Reassess Audit Table Migration File.


## Action 734 - Audit Table Migration File Reassessment

Action 734 added docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-file-reassessment.md as a documentation-only reassessment of the local audit table migration file supabase/migrations/20260615000000_create_execution_record_audit_events.sql. The reassessment verifies the migration file creates public.execution_record_audit_events locally with the expected columns, JSONB payloads, FK to public.execution_records(id), idempotency uniqueness, partial duplicate-prevention uniqueness, indexes, status/check constraints, safety comments, no permissive client write policies, and RLS/policy proof left as a blocker.

The reassessment confirms the migration file exists locally only, was not applied, does not prove the remote table exists, does not generate audit table types, does not prove RLS/security/server-only/service-role/route-auth safety, and does not create audit writer, audit route, production route, route call, insert route call, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write behavior, audit append implementation, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation/reconciliation, notification, broker/order behavior, Avanza/browser behavior, automatic mode, or downstream authority. Dry-run/dev-preview diagnostics remain not proof.

Action 733 validation evidence remains: tsc passed, lint passed, git diff check passed, zero-byte docs check passed, sandbox e2e hit the known EPERM 0.0.0.0:3010 blocker before app logic, and escalated full e2e passed 139/139. Recommended next action: Action 735 - Create Audit Table Migration Application Verification Plan.

## Action 735 - Audit Table Migration Application Verification Plan

- Added docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-application-verification-plan.md as the documentation-only plan for future verification of supabase/migrations/20260615000000_create_execution_record_audit_events.sql.
- The plan defines preconditions, future/manual application commands, remote table verification, RLS/security verification, generated audit type follow-up, rollback/failure handling, evidence artifacts with reviewer/date/pass-fail/blocker fields, safety boundaries, remaining blockers, risks, and verification.
- No migration was applied, no Supabase mutation commands were run, no generated audit types were produced, no remote table/RLS/security proof is claimed, and no writer, route, route call, insert path, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit append, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation, UI notification, broker behavior, Avanza behavior, or automatic mode was added.
- Recommended next action: Action 736 - Reassess Audit Table Migration Application Verification Plan.

## Action 736 - Audit Table Migration Application Verification Plan Reassessment

- Added docs/execution-record-audit-table-migration-application-verification-plan-reassessment.md as the documentation-only reassessment of the Action 735 audit table migration application verification plan.
- The reassessment verifies the plan remains future/manual and non-proof, covers preconditions, command planning, remote table inspection, RLS/security checks, generated audit type follow-up, failure/rollback handling, evidence artifact fields, safety boundaries, remaining blockers, risks, and a concrete next action.
- No migration was applied, no Supabase mutation commands were run, no generated audit types were created, no remote table/RLS/security proof is claimed, and no writer, route, route call, insert path, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit append, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation, UI notification, broker behavior, Avanza behavior, or automatic mode was added.
- Recommended next action: Action 737 - Create Audit Table Generated Types Plan.

## Action 737 - Audit Table Generated Types Plan

- Added docs/execution-record-audit-table-generated-types-plan.md as the documentation-only plan for future Supabase TypeScript type generation and verification for public.execution_record_audit_events after the audit migration is applied and proven.
- The plan defines preconditions, future/manual generation commands, expected Row/Insert/Update/Relationships shape, verification checklist, type drift/blocker rules, relationships to audit writer, RLS/security, and migration proof, evidence artifacts, safety boundaries, risks, and next action.
- No migration was applied, no Supabase mutation commands were run, no type-generation commands were run, no generated type files were modified, no generated audit type proof is claimed, and no writer, route, route call, insert path, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit append, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation, UI notification, broker behavior, Avanza behavior, or automatic mode was added.
- Recommended next action: Action 738 - Reassess Audit Table Generated Types Plan.

## Action 738 - Audit Table Generated Types Plan Reassessment

- Added docs/execution-record-audit-table-generated-types-plan-reassessment.md as the documentation-only reassessment of the Action 737 generated types plan for public.execution_record_audit_events.
- The reassessment verifies the plan remains future/manual and non-proof, covers preconditions, type-generation command planning, expected Row/Insert/Update/Relationships shape, verification checklist, drift/blocker rules, writer/RLS/security/migration relationships, evidence artifacts, safety boundaries, remaining blockers, risks, and a concrete next action.
- No migration was applied, no Supabase mutation commands were run, no type-generation commands were run, no generated type files were modified, no generated audit type proof is claimed, and no writer, route, route call, insert path, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit append, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation, UI notification, broker behavior, Avanza behavior, or automatic mode was added.
- Recommended next action: Action 739 - Create RLS/Security Policy Design.

## Action 739 - RLS/Security Policy Design

- Added docs/execution-record-audit-rls-security-policy-design.md as the documentation-only RLS/security policy design for the future public.execution_record_audit_events table and audit writer path.
- The design defines desired security posture, RLS stance options, proposed policy model, server-only/service-role requirements, route/auth requirements, verification requirements, evidence artifacts, relationships to migration/generated types/audit writer/production insert route, remaining blockers, risks, and next action.
- No RLS policies were created or applied, no migration was applied, no Supabase mutation commands were run, no type-generation commands were run, no generated type files were modified, no RLS/security/server-only/service-role/route-auth proof is claimed, and no writer, route, route call, insert path, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit append, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation, UI notification, broker behavior, Avanza behavior, or automatic mode was added.
- Recommended next action: Action 740 - Reassess RLS/Security Policy Design.

## Action 740 - RLS/Security Policy Design Reassessment

- Added docs/execution-record-audit-rls-security-policy-design-reassessment.md as the documentation-only reassessment of the Action 739 RLS/security policy design for public.execution_record_audit_events.
- The reassessment verifies the design remains non-proof and covers desired security posture, RLS stance options, proposed policy model, server-only/service-role requirements, route/auth requirements, verification/evidence coverage, relationships, remaining blockers, risks, and a concrete next action.
- No RLS policies were created or applied, no migration was applied, no Supabase mutation commands were run, no type-generation commands were run, no generated type files were modified, no RLS/security/server-only/service-role/route-auth proof is claimed, and no writer, route, route call, insert path, execution-record creation, persistence/write behavior, Supabase/localStorage write, audit append, stats/PnL update, rollback/correction, trade mutation, UI notification, broker behavior, Avanza behavior, or automatic mode was added.
- Recommended next action: Action 741 - Create Server-Only Service Role Proof Plan.
