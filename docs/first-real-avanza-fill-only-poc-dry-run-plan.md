  fill-only POC dry-run can occur.
- Recommended next action: Action 1021 - Add First Fill-Only POC Dry-Run
  Harness Stub.
- No runtime code, browser automation, Avanza access, DOM querying, field
  filling, clicking, submit, provider/route/scan call, Supabase/DB write,
  migration, type generation, generated type edit, `.env.local` change, audit
  writer client invocation, real trade, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was
  performed.

## Purpose

Action 1019 defines the first real Avanza fill-only POC dry-run plan.

This is not implementation. This is not approval to execute a real dry-run.
This is not order execution. Final confirm remains forbidden for Ture/agent.
The plan does not authorize browser automation, Avanza access from code, DOM
querying, field filling, clicking, review-stage behavior, final confirmation,
or order placement.

## Readiness Basis

- Real Avanza UI reconnaissance passed with warnings.
- Real Avanza DOM/selector reconnaissance passed with warnings.
- Static selector mapping contract exists.
- Selector contract is integrated into the fill-only guard.
- Max amount guard exists with a 1,000 SEK cap.
- Human-final-confirmation guards pass.
- Browser automation safety boundary exists.
- No real Avanza automation has been implemented.
- No real Avanza field filling has been attempted or approved.

## Proposed First POC Scope

- User logs in manually.
- User opens Avanza manually.
- User manually opens the correct instrument/order form unless search-stage
  automation is separately approved.
- First scope is buy-only.
- Order type must be Avancerad / Limit.
- Amount-based sizing is recommended because the cap is SEK.
- Max notional cap: 1,000 SEK or lower.
- Stop point: after fields are filled and total amount is verified, before
  clicking `Granska köp`.
- No confirmation modal by default.
- No sell.
- No Stop Loss.
- No Glidande.
- No review-stage behavior.
- No final submit.

## Explicitly Allowed Future Dry-Run Actions After Separate Approval

- Read instrument summary.
- Read selected account.
- Read side state.
- Read selected order type.
- Fill `Belopp i SEK` with an approved value under cap.
- Fill `Kurs i USD` with an approved price.
- Optionally fill `Antal` only if quantity-mode is explicitly approved.
- Read total amount.
- Read validation states.
- Stop.

## Blocked Actions For First POC

## Recommended Next Action

Action 1020 - Add First Fill-Only POC Approval Checklist.

Reason: before any real dry-run, require an explicit approval checklist separate
from this plan.

## Safety Statement

This plan does not authorize automation. This plan does not authorize clicking.
This plan does not authorize field filling yet. Separate explicit user approval
is required before any dry-run. Final confirm is permanently forbidden for
Ture/agent.

## Validation Results

  `runtime-denial-script-absent`.
- Audit writer runtime path import search returned no app/components/hooks
  matches.
- Route invocation, UI/app-shell audit writer import, market-loop/scanner,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_*SERVICE*`, service-role leakage, first-fill-only-poc-plan
  executable safety, automatic-mode, dead-doc/path, status string, and
  next-action scans passed or returned expected docs-only/policy references
  without invoking runtime behavior or printing secrets.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Touched-file trailing whitespace scan returned no matches.
