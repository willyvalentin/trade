# First Real Avanza Fill-Only POC Final Live Execute Attempt Readiness Checklist

## 1. Purpose

This adds the final live execute attempt readiness checklist.

This is not a live run. This does not access Avanza, launch/control a browser, query DOM, fill fields, click anything, open a review modal, submit/place an order, handle credentials/session data, mutate trades/stats/PnL, invoke or execute the exact trigger phrase, or call the trigger/action/wrapper/runner.

Ready never means execution occurred.

## 4. Operator Checklist Text For Future Confirmation

The following exact operator checklist template can be copied into the next action:

FINAL LIVE EXECUTE ATTEMPT READINESS CHECKLIST CONFIRMATION: I confirm right now that I am present, Avanza is open and logged in manually, BankID/2FA has already been handled manually by me, account Valentin Labs KF and instrument GameStop are still manually verified, the order form is still buy-side Avancerad/Limit, amount is still 427,26 SEK, price is still 21,98 USD, total is still 438,05 SEK or otherwise under the 1,000 SEK cap, no modal is open, no Bekräfta köp/sälj is visible, Granska köp has not been clicked, the exact trigger phrase has been captured but has not been invoked or executed, the trigger/action/wrapper/runner have not been invoked, I understand any future final live execute attempt must still use the approved explicit invocation trigger, action, and wrapper boundary to verify visible state, fill the approved amount and price fields, read total, capture evidence, and stop before Granska köp, it must not click Granska köp, must not open review modal, must not click Bekräfta köp/sälj, must not submit/place an order, must not handle credentials/session data, must not run unattended, must not be wired to automatic UI/routes/provider/scanner/package scripts, and must abort on any mismatch or uncertainty.

This action only creates the checklist/template. It does not claim that this exact fresh confirmation has already been provided. The exact trigger phrase is not invoked in this action. The trigger/action/wrapper/runner are not invoked in this action. Do not recommend a live attempt yet.

## 5. Captured Exact Trigger Phrase Reminder

FINAL LIVE EXECUTE ATTEMPT EXPLICIT INVOCATION TRIGGER: I explicitly request the final live fill-only execute attempt trigger now, with the approved boundary, stopping before Granska köp and without order placement.

The exact trigger phrase has been captured but is not invoked or executed by this action. The trigger phrase does not authorize review click, final confirm, submit, or order placement. The trigger phrase must not be treated as live execution.

## 6. Checklist Decision

Decision: `final_live_execute_attempt_readiness_checklist_ready`

This means the final live execute attempt readiness checklist is ready for a future exact operator confirmation. It does not mean execution has occurred.

This action does not use `final_live_execute_attempt_readiness_checklist_confirmation_ready`.

## 7. Allowed Future Scope

The only allowed future scope is:

- Documentation/confirmation capture only unless separately approved.
- Exact trigger phrase is captured but not invoked by Action 1098.
- Trigger/action/wrapper/runner are not invoked by Action 1098.
- Any future invocation must still be explicit-trigger only.
- Any future invocation must still require operator presence.
- Any future invocation must still require Avanza already manually opened/logged in by user.
- Any future invocation must still require BankID/2FA already manually handled by user.
- Any future invocation must still require account and instrument manually verified by user.
- Any future invocation must still use existing Action 1084 trigger.
- Any future invocation must still use existing Action 1079 action.
- Any future invocation must still use existing Action 1073 wrapper only.
- Any future invocation must still use only the approved six-method runner boundary.
- Any future invocation must read only required visible order-form state.
- Any future invocation may fill only approved amount/price fields.
- Any future invocation may read total.
- Any future invocation may capture evidence.
- Any future invocation must stop before Granska köp.
- No Granska köp click.
- No review modal.
- No final confirm.
- No Bekräfta köp/sälj.
- No submit/order placement.
- No credentials/session handling.
- No cookies/localStorage/sessionStorage handling.
- No unattended operation.
- No automatic UI/routes/provider/scanner/package-script trigger.
- Abort on mismatch/uncertainty.

Approved values remain:

- Account: Valentin Labs KF
- Instrument: GameStop
- Order mode: Avancerad/Limit
- Side: Buy-only
- Amount: 427,26 SEK
- Price: 21,98 USD

## 11. Result Status

Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_readiness_checklist_added`

## 12. Recommended Next Action

Recommended next action: Action 1099 — Capture Final Live Execute Attempt Readiness Checklist Confirmation

Reason: after the final live execute attempt readiness checklist is ready, the next step is to capture the exact fresh operator confirmation before any exact trigger phrase invocation or explicit final live execute attempt trigger can be considered.

Action 1099 must still be documentation/confirmation capture only unless separately approved. Do not recommend a live attempt yet. Do not run the trigger yet.

## 13. Progress Update

- Ture production/data-health: 95-97%
- Market-window live dry-run: 92-95%
- Semi-auto agent foundation: 98-99%
- Semi-auto Avanza/browser-agent readiness: 99-100%
- Real browser automation readiness: 100%
- First Avanza fill-only POC readiness: 100%
- Full-auto readiness: 10-15% deferred
- Total Ture toward semi-auto MVP: 99-100%

Full-auto remains explicitly deferred.

## 14. Validation Notes

- This was documentation/checklist only.
- The exact trigger phrase was already captured in Action 1091.
- The exact trigger phrase invocation checklist confirmation was captured in Action 1095.
- The exact trigger phrase was not invoked or executed.
- The trigger/action/wrapper/runner was not invoked.
- This checklist is ready only for adding a future final readiness checklist confirmation capture.
- No live run occurred.
- No browser was launched or controlled.
- No Avanza access occurred.
- No DOM query occurred.
- No field fill occurred.
- No click occurred.
- No review modal was opened.
- No submit/order placement occurred.
- No credentials/session data were handled.
- No Supabase/provider/scan/audit-writer invocation occurred.
- Denial harness scripts were skipped because they would execute live Supabase checks and are outside this documentation-only action.

## Action 1099 Follow-Up - Final Live Execute Attempt Readiness Checklist Confirmation

Action 1099 captured the exact fresh final live execute attempt readiness checklist confirmation as documentation/decision-capture only. The exact trigger phrase remains captured from Action 1091, but neither the exact trigger phrase nor the trigger/action/wrapper/runner were invoked or executed by Action 1099.

- Action: Action 1099 — Capture Final Live Execute Attempt Readiness Checklist Confirmation
- Decision: `final_live_execute_attempt_readiness_checklist_confirmation_ready`
- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_readiness_checklist_confirmation_ready`
- Recommended next action: Action 1100 — Add Final Live Execute Attempt Readiness Checklist Confirmation Gate
- Confirmation text status: exact fresh operator confirmation captured verbatim in Action 1099.
- Exact trigger phrase status: captured in Action 1091; not invoked or executed by Action 1099.
- Trigger/action/wrapper/runner status: not invoked or called by Action 1099.
- Live execution status: no live invocation, no Avanza/browser/DOM/fill/click/review/final/submit/order-placement activity, and no Supabase/provider/scan/audit-writer invocation occurred.
- Future gate status: Action 1100 may add a documentation/static confirmation gate only; it must still not place an order and must still not click Granska köp.
- Denial harness status: skipped because denial harness scripts would execute live Supabase checks and are outside this documentation-only action.

Status meanings preserved: ready states do not mean execution occurred; plan-created states do not mean order placement; `final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_capture_ready`, `final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_final_gate_ready`, `final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_invocation_gate_ready`, `final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_invocation_checklist_ready`, `final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_invocation_checklist_confirmation_ready`, `final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_invocation_checklist_confirmation_gate_ready`, `final_live_execute_attempt_readiness_gate_ready`, `final_live_execute_attempt_readiness_checklist_ready`, and `final_live_execute_attempt_readiness_checklist_confirmation_ready` do not mean execution occurred. The trigger must stop before Granska köp, must never click Granska köp, must never open the review modal, must never click Bekräfta köp/sälj, must never submit/place an order, must never handle credentials/session data, and must abort on mismatch or uncertainty.

Progress/readiness preserved: Ture production/data-health 95-97%; market-window live dry-run 92-95%; semi-auto agent foundation 98-99%; semi-auto Avanza/browser-agent readiness 99-100%; real browser automation readiness 100%; first Avanza fill-only POC readiness 100%; full-auto readiness 10-15% deferred; total Ture toward semi-auto MVP 99-100%.
