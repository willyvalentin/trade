## Action 1066 Follow-Up - Live Invocation Execution Gate

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_live_invocation_execution_gate_added`.
- Added `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-live-invocation-execution-gate.md` as the final documentation/decision gate before adding any live invocation execute wrapper/action.
- Gate decision: `live_invocation_execution_gate_ready`. This means ready to add a live invocation execution action/wrapper; it does not mean execution has occurred.
- Gate basis: immediate pre-invocation confirmation ready, final operator GO captured, live invocation run attempt gate ready, live invocation attempt dry-run simulation passed, final live attempt preflight checklist ready, all hard stops active, and no live invocation performed.
- Allowed future execution scope remains explicit-trigger only, user present, browser already manually opened, Avanza already manually logged in, read only required visible order-form state, fill only approved amount/price fields, capture evidence, and stop before `Granska köp`.
- Mandatory aborts remain operator absent, browser/session not prepared, account/instrument mismatch, wrong side/order type, amount/price mismatch, total parse failure, cap exceeded, validation errors, modal open, final confirm visible, review click targeted/requested, submit/order placement requested, credential/session handling requested, or any uncertainty.
- This remains documentation/decision-gate only: no live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.
- Recommended next action: Action 1067 - Add Live Invocation Execute Wrapper.

## Action 1065 Follow-Up - Immediate Pre-Invocation Confirmation Ready

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_ready`.
- Updated `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-immediate-pre-invocation-confirmation.md` to capture the exact operator-provided `IMMEDIATE PRE-INVOKE CONFIRMATION:` wording.
- Decision transition: `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_deferred` -> `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_ready`.
- Confirmation scope: operator present right now; Avanza open and logged in manually; BankID/2FA handled manually; Valentin Labs KF and GameStop still manually verified; buy-side Avancerad/Limit; amount 427,26 SEK; price 21,98 USD; total 438,05 SEK or otherwise under the 1,000 SEK cap; no modal open; no `Bekräfta köp/sälj` visible; `Granska köp` has not been clicked; browser can be closed immediately if anything is wrong; invocation must stop before `Granska köp`; abort on mismatch or uncertainty.
- Remaining hard stops: no `Granska köp`, no review modal, no `Bekräfta köp/sälj`, no submit/order placement, no unattended run, no credential/session handling, no sell/Stop Loss/Glidande, no cap above 1,000 SEK, and abort on mismatch/uncertainty.
- This remains documentation/decision-capture only: no live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.

## Action 1064 Follow-Up - Immediate Pre-Invocation Confirmation

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_added`.
- Added `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-immediate-pre-invocation-confirmation.md` to capture whether the operator provided the immediate pre-invocation confirmation.
- Current decision: `immediate_pre_invocation_confirmation_deferred`. The current instruction did not include the exact required immediate confirmation text.
- Required exact wording is documented for the next operator input.
- Carry-forward state remains: final preflight ready, final operator GO captured, live attempt gate ready, dry-run simulation passed, hard stops active, and no live invocation performed.
- No live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.
- Recommended next action: Action 1065 - Provide Immediate Pre-Invocation Confirmation.

## Action 1063 Follow-Up - Final Live Attempt Preflight Checklist

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_attempt_preflight_checklist_added`.
- Added `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-final-live-attempt-preflight-checklist.md` as the final operator/system checklist immediately before any future live fill-only invocation attempt.
- Checklist decision: `final_live_attempt_preflight_ready`. This means the checklist is ready; it does not mean a live run occurred and does not authorize review, final confirm, submit, or order placement.
- Preflight basis records FINAL GO, run attempt gate readiness, dry-run simulation pass, fresh evidence readiness, operator checklist readiness, and active hard stops.
- The checklist covers final operator confirmation, final Browser/Avanza state, final wrapper/run boundary, and immediate abort conditions.
- No live run, browser launch/control, Avanza access, DOM query, field fill, click, submit/order placement, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer import, browser automation, credential/session handling, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.

## Action 1062 Follow-Up - Live Invocation Attempt Dry-Run Simulation

- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_live_fill_only_invocation_attempt_dry_run_simulation_added`.
- Added `tests/e2e/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-live-fill-only-invocation-attempt-dry-run-simulation.spec.ts` as a local-only dry-run simulation for the Action 1061 attempt wrapper.
- Added `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-live-fill-only-invocation-attempt-dry-run-simulation.md` with the Action 1062 proof.
- Positive simulation reaches `attempt_plan_created` / `ready_for_live_fill_only_attempt` with all gates, final GO, final harness, final pre-run evidence, operator confirmations, cap, buy side, Avancerad/Limit, and evidence plan satisfied.
- Negative simulation coverage blocks or fails safety for disabled wrapper, missing gates/GO/wrapper/harness/evidence/operator/login/account/instrument, cap above 1,000 SEK, wrong side/order type, review/final/submit/order placement, credential/session handling, sell, Stop Loss, and Glidande.
- Runner boundary remains metadata-only; no fake runner or real runner is invoked.
- No live Avanza run, real browser launch/control, DOM query, credential/session handling, review click, review modal, final confirm, submit, order placement, Supabase/DB write, provider/scan route invocation, audit writer client invocation, migration/typegen/generated type edit, .env.local change, real trade, or trade/stats/PnL mutation was performed.

# First Real Avanza Fill-Only POC Final Pre-Run Evidence Checklist

## Purpose

This document defines the final pre-run evidence checklist that must be completed immediately before any future real browser fill-only run attempt.

This is documentation/checklist only. It is not a live run and does not access Avanza, launch or control a browser, query DOM, fill fields, click `Granska kop`, open a review modal, click `Bekrafta kop`, click `Bekrafta salj`, submit, or place an order.

This checklist does not add browser automation, runtime code, Playwright/Puppeteer imports, provider calls, route calls, Supabase calls, service-role calls, migrations, type generation, generated type edits, audit writer UI/client invocation, broker behavior, automatic mode, credential/session handling, or trade/stats/PnL mutation.

## Evidence Timing

Evidence must be fresh and captured immediately before any future real browser fill-only run attempt.

Old screenshots, old setup evidence, old manual-login evidence, old selector reconnaissance, and old order-form observations are not sufficient for a future real run. The operator must confirm the live state manually at the time of the attempted run.

If any evidence is stale, missing, inconsistent, unclear, or no longer visible, the run must be deferred or blocked before browser automation is considered.

## Required Operator Evidence

The operator must confirm each item immediately before a future fill-only run attempt:

- [ ] User/operator is present and watching the browser.
- [ ] Browser is already opened manually by the operator.
- [ ] Avanza is already opened manually by the operator.
- [ ] Avanza is already logged in manually by the operator.
- [ ] BankID/2FA has already been handled manually by the operator.
- [ ] No credentials are shared with code, logs, docs, screenshots, or Codex.
- [ ] No session data, cookies, localStorage, or sessionStorage are shared or copied.
- [ ] Account is manually verified by the operator.
- [ ] Instrument is manually verified by the operator.
- [ ] Order form is visible.
- [ ] Buy side is active.
- [ ] Avancerad/Limit is selected.
- [ ] Amount field is visible.
- [ ] Price field is visible.
- [ ] Total amount field/output is visible.
- [ ] No modal is open.
- [ ] No final confirm is visible.
- [ ] No `Bekrafta kop` or `Bekrafta salj` is visible.
- [ ] `Granska kop` has not been clicked.
- [ ] No order has been placed.
- [ ] Kill switch is understood by the operator.
- [ ] Browser can be closed immediately if any mismatch or uncertainty occurs.

## Required Run Values

The operator must capture or state each intended run value immediately before any future run attempt:

- [ ] Instrument/ticker.
- [ ] Account label or redacted account identifier.
- [ ] Intended amount in SEK.
- [ ] Intended price.
- [ ] Cap in SEK, with cap <= 1,000.
- [ ] Expected order side: buy.
- [ ] Expected order type: Avancerad/Limit.
- [ ] Stop point: before `Granska kop`.

## Screenshot And Evidence Handling

Screenshots may be used as operator evidence when helpful.

Evidence handling requirements:

- Redact sensitive account, balance, personal, and business information where possible.
- Do not store credentials.
- Do not store BankID/2FA data.
- Do not copy or store cookies.
- Do not copy or store localStorage or sessionStorage.
- Do not capture session tokens.
- Do not include service-role values or other secrets.
- Evidence should show only the minimum necessary order-form state.
- Evidence should support account, instrument, side, order type, amount field, price field, total amount visibility, and stop-before-review verification.

## Mandatory Abort Conditions

The future run must stop before any browser automation or field-fill action if any abort condition is present:

- User/operator is not present.
- Browser is not already opened manually.
- Avanza is not already logged in manually.
- Account is not manually verified.
- Instrument is not manually verified.
- Wrong side is visible or selected.
- Wrong order type is visible or selected.
- Cap is above 1,000 SEK.
- Amount mismatch.
- Price mismatch.
- Total amount parse failure.
- Any validation error.
- A modal is open.
- Final confirm is visible.
- `Granska kop` is targeted or click is requested.
- Submit/order placement is requested.
- Credential handling is requested.
- Session handling is requested.
- Cookie, localStorage, or sessionStorage handling is requested.
- Any selector, label, field, account, instrument, side, type, amount, price, or total is uncertain.
- Any unexpected Avanza state is visible.

## Pre-Run Evidence Checklist Decision

Current decision: `final_pre_run_evidence_deferred`.

Reason: this action creates the checklist only. Fresh immediate pre-run evidence has not been captured yet.

Allowed decisions for a future evidence capture action:

- `final_pre_run_evidence_ready`.
- `final_pre_run_evidence_deferred`.
- `final_pre_run_evidence_blocked`.

## Result Status

Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_pre_run_evidence_checklist_added`.

## Recommended Next Action

Recommended next action: Action 1049 - Capture Final Pre-Run Evidence.

After this checklist exists, fresh operator-provided evidence must be captured immediately before any future real browser fill-only run attempt.
