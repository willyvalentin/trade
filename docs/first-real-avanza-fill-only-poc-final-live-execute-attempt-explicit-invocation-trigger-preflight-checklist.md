# First Real Avanza Fill-Only POC - Final Live Execute Attempt Explicit Invocation Trigger Preflight Checklist

## 1. Purpose

This adds the final live execute attempt explicit invocation trigger preflight checklist.

This is not a live run. It does not access Avanza, launch or control a browser, query DOM, fill fields, click anything, open a review modal, submit, place an order, handle credentials or session data, or mutate trades, stats, or PnL.

Ready never means execution occurred.

## 2. Checklist Basis

This checklist is based on the following completed and preserved states:

- Final live execute attempt explicit invocation trigger simulation passed: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_simulation_added`

- No live invocation has been performed.
- No order has been placed.

Status meanings remain unchanged:

- `ready_for_final_live_execute_attempt` does not mean execution occurred.

## 4. Operator Checklist Text For Future Confirmation

The following exact operator checklist template may be copied into the next action:

`FINAL LIVE EXECUTE ATTEMPT EXPLICIT INVOCATION TRIGGER PREFLIGHT CONFIRMATION: I confirm right now that I am present, Avanza is open and logged in manually, BankID/2FA has already been handled manually by me, account Valentin Labs KF and instrument GameStop are still manually verified, the order form is still buy-side Avancerad/Limit, amount is still 427,26 SEK, price is still 21,98 USD, total is still 438,05 SEK or otherwise under the 1,000 SEK cap, no modal is open, no Bekräfta köp/sälj is visible, Granska köp has not been clicked, I understand the explicit invocation trigger is explicit-trigger-only, disabled by default unless explicitly requested, requires the exact trigger phrase, may only delegate to the approved explicit invocation action and wrapper boundary to verify visible state, fill the approved amount and price fields, read total, capture evidence, and stop before Granska köp, it must not click Granska köp, must not open review modal, must not click Bekräfta köp/sälj, must not submit/place an order, must not handle credentials/session data, must not run unattended, must not be wired to automatic UI/routes/provider/scanner/package scripts, and must abort on any mismatch or uncertainty.`

This action only creates the checklist/template. It does not claim that this exact fresh confirmation has already been provided.

## 5. Exact Trigger Phrase Reminder

A future action may separately require this exact trigger phrase:

`FINAL LIVE EXECUTE ATTEMPT EXPLICIT INVOCATION TRIGGER: I explicitly request the final live fill-only execute attempt trigger now, with the approved boundary, stopping before Granska köp and without order placement.`

The trigger phrase does not authorize review click, final confirm, submit, or order placement.

The trigger phrase is not captured by this action.

## 6. Checklist Decision

`final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_preflight_checklist_ready`

This means the explicit invocation trigger preflight checklist is ready for a final explicit operator confirmation. It does not mean execution has occurred.

This action does not use `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_preflight_confirmation_ready`.

## 7. Allowed Future Explicit Trigger Scope

Only the following future scope is allowed:

- Explicit-trigger only.
- Exact trigger phrase required.
- User/operator present.
- Avanza already manually opened/logged in by user.
- BankID/2FA already manually handled by user.
- Account and instrument already manually verified by user.
- Use existing Action 1084 explicit invocation trigger.
- Use existing Action 1079 explicit invocation action.
- Use existing Action 1073 wrapper only.
- Use only the approved six-method runner boundary.
- Read only required visible order-form state.
- Fill only approved amount/price fields.
- Read total.
- Capture evidence.
- Stop before Granska kop.

1. `verifyVisibleOrderFormState`
2. `fillAmountField`
3. `fillPriceField`
4. `readTotalAmount`
5. `captureEvidence`
6. `stopBeforeReview`

## 12. Recommended Next Action

Action 1087 - Capture Final Live Execute Attempt Explicit Invocation Trigger Preflight Confirmation

After the explicit invocation trigger preflight checklist is ready, the next step is to capture the exact fresh operator confirmation before any exact trigger phrase or explicit final live execute attempt trigger can be considered.

Action 1087 must still be documentation/confirmation capture only unless separately approved.

Do not recommend a live attempt yet. Do not recommend posting the exact trigger phrase yet.

## 13. Progress Update

- Ture production/data-health: 95-97%
- Market-window live dry-run: 92-95%
- Semi-auto agent foundation: 98-99%
- Semi-auto Avanza/browser-agent readiness: 99-100%
- Real browser automation readiness: 100%
- First Avanza fill-only POC readiness: 100%
- Full-auto readiness: 10-15% deferred
- Total Ture toward semi-auto MVP: 99-100%

Full-auto remains deferred.

## 14. Validation Notes

This was documentation/checklist only.

No live run occurred. No browser was launched or controlled. No Avanza access occurred. No DOM query occurred. No field fill occurred. No click occurred. No review modal was opened. No submit/order placement occurred. No credentials/session data were handled. No Supabase/provider/scan/audit-writer invocation occurred.

Denial harness scripts were skipped because they are outside this action's documentation-only scope and may execute live Supabase checks.

## Action 1086 Follow-Up - Final Live Execute Attempt Explicit Invocation Trigger Preflight Checklist

Action 1086 — Add Final Live Execute Attempt Explicit Invocation Trigger Preflight Checklist completed with checklist decision: `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_preflight_checklist_ready`.

Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_preflight_checklist_added`.

This means the explicit invocation trigger preflight checklist is ready for a final explicit operator confirmation. It does not mean execution has occurred. This action does not use or claim `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_preflight_confirmation_ready`.

Preserved prior states include `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_simulation_added`, `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_added`, `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_final_gate_ready`, `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_final_gate_added`, `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_preflight_confirmation_ready`, `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_preflight_confirmation_ready`, `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_preflight_checklist_ready`, `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_preflight_checklist_added`, `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_simulation_added`, `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_action_added`, `final_live_execute_attempt_execution_gate_ready`, `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_execution_gate_added`, `final_live_execute_attempt_checklist_confirmation_ready`, `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_checklist_confirmation_ready`, `final_live_execute_attempt_checklist_ready`, `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_checklist_added`, `final_execute_attempt_gate_ready`, `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_execute_attempt_gate_added`, `execute_checklist_confirmation_ready`, `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_execute_checklist_confirmation_ready`, `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_wrapper_added`, `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_wrapper_simulation_added`, `ready_for_final_live_execute_attempt`, `final_live_execute_attempt_plan_created`, `ready_for_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation`, `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_plan_created`, `ready_for_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger`, and `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_plan_created`.

Safety note: Action 1086 is documentation/checklist only. It does not perform a live invocation, does not access Avanza, does not launch/control a browser, does not query DOM, does not fill fields, does not click Granska kop, does not open a review modal, does not click Bekrafta kop/salj, does not submit/place an order, does not handle credentials/session data, and does not call Supabase/provider/scanner/routes/audit-writer paths.

Recommended next action: Action 1087 — Capture Final Live Execute Attempt Explicit Invocation Trigger Preflight Confirmation. Action 1087 must still be documentation/confirmation capture only unless separately approved; this is not a recommendation to run a live attempt or post the exact trigger phrase.

Progress/readiness preserved:

- Ture production/data-health: 95-97%
- Market-window live dry-run: 92-95%
- Semi-auto agent foundation: 98-99%
- Semi-auto Avanza/browser-agent readiness: 99-100%

- Full-auto readiness: 10-15% deferred
- Total Ture toward semi-auto MVP: 99-100%

## Action 1087 Follow-Up - Final Live Execute Attempt Explicit Invocation Trigger Preflight Confirmation

Action 1087 — Capture Final Live Execute Attempt Explicit Invocation Trigger Preflight Confirmation completed with confirmation decision: `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_preflight_confirmation_deferred`.

Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_preflight_confirmation_added`.

Reason: the exact fresh `FINAL LIVE EXECUTE ATTEMPT EXPLICIT INVOCATION TRIGGER PREFLIGHT CONFIRMATION:` text was not provided in the Action 1087 request. The expected template is documented as a template only, and the exact trigger phrase is documented as a reminder only, not invoked.

Recommended next action: Action 1088 — Provide Final Live Execute Attempt Explicit Invocation Trigger Preflight Confirmation. Action 1088 must still be documentation/confirmation capture only unless separately approved; this is not a recommendation to run a live attempt or post the exact trigger phrase.

Status meanings remain unchanged: ready states do not mean execution occurred, plan-created states do not mean order placement, and trigger readiness does not authorize review click, final confirm, submit, or order placement.

Safety note: Action 1087 is documentation/confirmation-state only. It does not perform a live invocation, does not access Avanza, does not launch/control a browser, does not query DOM, does not fill fields, does not click Granska kop, does not open a review modal, does not click Bekrafta kop/salj, does not submit/place an order, does not handle credentials/session data, and does not call Supabase/provider/scanner/routes/audit-writer paths. Confirmation remains deferred until the exact fresh operator confirmation is provided.

Progress/readiness remains: Ture production/data-health 95–97%; market-window live dry-run 92–95%; semi-auto agent foundation 98–99%; semi-auto Avanza/browser-agent readiness 99–100%; real browser automation readiness 100%; first Avanza fill-only POC readiness 100%; full-auto readiness 10–15% deferred; total Ture toward semi-auto MVP 99–100%.

## Action 1088 Follow-Up - Final Live Execute Attempt Explicit Invocation Trigger Preflight Confirmation Ready

Action 1088 — Capture Final Live Execute Attempt Explicit Invocation Trigger Preflight Confirmation completed with confirmation decision: `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_preflight_confirmation_ready`.

Decision transition: `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_preflight_confirmation_deferred -> final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_preflight_confirmation_ready`.

Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_preflight_confirmation_ready`.

Captured confirmation: the exact fresh `FINAL LIVE EXECUTE ATTEMPT EXPLICIT INVOCATION TRIGGER PREFLIGHT CONFIRMATION:` text was provided in Action 1088 and recorded verbatim in `docs/first-real-avanza-fill-only-poc-final-live-execute-attempt-explicit-invocation-trigger-preflight-confirmation.md`. This is the trigger preflight confirmation, not the exact trigger phrase.

Recommended next action: Action 1089 — Add Final Live Execute Attempt Explicit Invocation Trigger Final Gate. Action 1089 must still not place an order and must still not click Granska kop. This is not a recommendation to run a live attempt or post the exact trigger phrase.

Status meanings remain unchanged: ready states do not mean execution occurred, plan-created states do not mean order placement, and trigger readiness does not authorize review click, final confirm, submit, or order placement.

Safety note: Action 1088 is documentation/decision-capture only. It does not perform a live invocation, does not invoke the exact trigger phrase, does not access Avanza, does not launch/control a browser, does not query DOM, does not fill fields, does not click Granska kop, does not open a review modal, does not click Bekrafta kop/salj, does not submit/place an order, does not handle credentials/session data, and does not call Supabase/provider/scanner/routes/audit-writer paths.

## Action 1089 Follow-Up - Final Live Execute Attempt Explicit Invocation Trigger Final Gate

Action 1089 — Add Final Live Execute Attempt Explicit Invocation Trigger Final Gate completed with final trigger gate decision: `final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_final_gate_ready`.

Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_explicit_invocation_trigger_final_gate_added`.

Gate meaning: ready only for adding a future exact trigger phrase capture/request action. It does not mean execution occurred, does not mean the exact trigger phrase was invoked, and does not authorize review click, final confirm, submit, or order placement.

Recommended next action: Action 1090 — Add Final Live Execute Attempt Exact Trigger Phrase Capture. Action 1090 must still not place an order and must still not click Granska kop. This is not a recommendation to run a live attempt or invoke the exact trigger phrase.

Status meanings remain unchanged: ready states do not mean execution occurred, plan-created states do not mean order placement, and trigger readiness does not authorize review click, final confirm, submit, or order placement.

Safety note: Action 1089 is documentation/static gate only. It does not perform a live invocation, does not invoke the exact trigger phrase, does not access Avanza, does not launch/control a browser, does not query DOM, does not fill fields, does not click Granska kop, does not open a review modal, does not click Bekrafta kop/salj, does not submit/place an order, does not handle credentials/session data, and does not call Supabase/provider/scanner/routes/audit-writer paths.

Progress/readiness remains: Ture production/data-health 95–97%; market-window live dry-run 92–95%; semi-auto agent foundation 98–99%; semi-auto Avanza/browser-agent readiness 99–100%; real browser automation readiness 100%; first Avanza fill-only POC readiness 100%; full-auto readiness 10–15% deferred; total Ture toward semi-auto MVP 99–100%.

## Action 1090 Follow-Up - Final Live Execute Attempt Exact Trigger Phrase Capture

Action 1090 added the final live execute attempt exact trigger phrase capture state document. Because the exact operator-provided trigger phrase was not included in the Action 1090 request, capture remains deferred and must not be treated as ready or invoked.

- Action: Action 1090 — Add Final Live Execute Attempt Exact Trigger Phrase Capture
- Decision: `final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_capture_deferred`
- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_exact_trigger_phrase_capture_added`
- Recommended next action: Action 1091 — Provide Final Live Execute Attempt Exact Trigger Phrase
- Exact trigger phrase status: template recorded only; exact phrase was not provided in the Action 1090 request.
- Exact trigger phrase invocation status: not invoked.
- Live execution status: no live invocation, no Avanza/browser/DOM/fill/click/review/final/submit/order-placement activity, and no Supabase/provider/scan/audit-writer invocation occurred.
- Denial harness status: skipped because denial harness scripts would execute live Supabase checks and are outside this documentation-only action.

The trigger must stop before Granska köp, must never click Granska köp, must never open the review modal, must never click Bekräfta köp/sälj, must never submit/place an order, must never handle credentials/session data, and must abort on mismatch or uncertainty.

Progress/readiness preserved: Ture production/data-health 95-97%; market-window live dry-run 92-95%; semi-auto agent foundation 98-99%; semi-auto Avanza/browser-agent readiness 99-100%; real browser automation readiness 100%; first Avanza fill-only POC readiness 100%; full-auto readiness 10-15% deferred; total Ture toward semi-auto MVP 99-100%.

## Action 1091 Follow-Up - Final Live Execute Attempt Exact Trigger Phrase Captured

## Action 1099 Follow-Up - Final Live Execute Attempt Readiness Checklist Confirmation

Action 1099 captured the exact fresh final live execute attempt readiness checklist confirmation as documentation/decision-capture only. The exact trigger phrase remains captured from Action 1091, but neither the exact trigger phrase nor the trigger/action/wrapper/runner were invoked or executed by Action 1099.

- Action: Action 1099 — Capture Final Live Execute Attempt Readiness Checklist Confirmation
- Decision: `final_live_execute_attempt_readiness_checklist_confirmation_ready`
- Result status: `first_real_avanza_fill_only_poc_final_live_execute_attempt_readiness_checklist_confirmation_ready`
- Recommended next action: Action 1100 — Add Final Live Execute Attempt Readiness Checklist Confirmation Gate
- Confirmation text status: exact fresh operator confirmation captured verbatim in Action 1099.
- Exact trigger phrase status: captured in Action 1091; not invoked or executed by Action 1099.
- Trigger/action/wrapper/runner status: not invoked or called by Action 1099.
- Live execution status: no live invocation, no Avanza/browser/DOM/fill/click/review/final/submit/order-placement activity, and no Supabase/provider/scan/audit-writer invocation occurred.
- Future gate status: Action 1100 may add a documentation/static confirmation gate only; it must still not place an order and must still not click Granska köp.
- Denial harness status: skipped because denial harness scripts would execute live Supabase checks and are outside this documentation-only action.
